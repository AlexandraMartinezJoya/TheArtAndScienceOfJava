The Judgement: The Dynamic, Supreme Success, It is Beneficial to Persevere

JudgementDescription: The Book of Changes begins with the dynamic principle, which has four basic attributes. It is fundamental (sublime, originating, and supreme), succesful (bestowing power), beneficial (advantegeous, and morally appropriate), and persevering(determined, steadfast, and upright). These are the four virtues of the Book of Changes. The four Chinese words for these atributes (yuan, heng li zhen) are often used to represent the four seasons, or virtually anything that can be divided into four. The four virtues are usually paired: fundamental with successful, and beneficial with persevering. Thus, the text says that dynamic action will help you achieve supreme success, and it is beneficial to persevere, to keep moving forward. To conduct yourself in accordance with the nature of the times, you should make the four virtues your own: attend to what is basic and fundamental, and perserve in what is beneficial and morally upright/ The text enjoins you to use your creative power for good - to bring order out of chaos, beauty out of squalor, peace out of tumult, and justice out of injustice. Quian signifies that you are in a very favorable situation if you take the right approach. This is not a time to hold back. Rather, you must take strong, decisive action. Seize the initiative. Go out into the world and make a difference. Be creative. Look for fresh and original ways to solve your problems. It is time to try something new and bold. If you move forward now with confidence, others will have confidence in you. If you are willing to act on your belifs and stand up for what you belive is right, people will look up to you and follow you. Your energy and enthusiasm will inspire them and this will help you achieve your goals. Have faith in yourself and maintain a positive attitude. You have every reason to be optimistic. ANd the more optimistic and enthusiastic you are about your project, the more you will help to ensure your ultimate success. No matter how dynamic and forceful you may be, however, strong action will amout to nothing if it is not for the right purposes. If you want to harness the right kind of creative power, you must be convinced that you are doing is correct and you must steadfastly maintain your integrity and uprightness. Go back to basics. Return to your most fundamental principles. People who know that their cause is just are the most powerful of all. Their heart, mind and spirit all aim at the same end. They embody the dynamic principle perfectly, hence they are like a force of nature. Because they harbor no doubts or inner conflicts, their energy and intiative are put to their highest use, and that is why they succed. In the same way if you want to make the most of this propitous hour, you must devote yourself to something that is truly worthy. You must employ your energies for honorable goals. Do not waste your time on things that are base, trivial or beneath you. The moment for creative action will not last forever, so do not squander it. Strong action also will not succed if it not carefully thought through and carried forward. Do not confuse dynamism with recklessness or creativity with carelessness. Plan ahead. Try and gauge the consequences of what you are about to do. Marshal your resources carefully, and when the time is right, do not be afraid to move forward boldly and decisively. Moreover, once you have begun, you must finish what you start. Behind creativity there must be commitment or your plans will amount to nothing. You must keep moving forward steadily and determinedly until you succed. Hence the text says that it is beneficial to persevere.

The image: Heaven moves constantly. Thus the superior person strengthens himself without pause.

The Judgement: The Receptive, Supreme Success, It is Beneficial to be constant like a mare. If the superior person sets out to do something, he will go astray, but if he follows, he will find guidance. It is beneficial to find friends in the southwest and forego friends in the northeast. Serene perserverence brings good fortune.

JudgementDescription: The four fundamental attributes yuan heng li zhen (fundamental, successful, beneficial, and persevering) describe IChingClasses.Kun as they do IChingClasses.Qian. However the "perseverence of a mare" in IChingClasses.Kun contrasts with Quian injunction of steadfast endurance. Whereas Quian advises us to pursue our ends constantly, doggedly, and incessantly like the ceasless movement of the heavens, IChingClasses.Kun advises us to accept and endure change, adjusting to and even welcoming what occurs. In place of untiring striving we should adopt the gentle and devoted perseverance of the mare. The mare follows the lead of the others and is by nature accomodating and accepting  - qualities which are appropriate to the sittuation. The mare also contrasts with the dragon featured in the line statements of IChingClasses.Qian. The dragon flies in the heavens and so symbolises heaven; the mare roams freely throughout the full extent of the earth and hence symbolises earth. The southwest means to seek assistence from other employing the virtues associated with earth, humility, devotion, cooperation, and responsiveness. In this context the northeast represents the opposite qualities. Therefore, in seeking friends one should avoid arogance, lack of commitment, selfishness, and indifference. Serene perserverance brings good fortune because we adapt ourselves to the situation and accept it for what it is. Hence we are able to do what the sittuation demands of us naturally and are able to make progress in exactly the right way. The sittuation you face requires responsivness to circumstances and devotion to doing the right thing given the specific context in which you find yourself. Responsivness does not mean lasstitude or passivity - it means action that is in accord with the demands of the situation , action that flows naturally with events rather than trying to resist or confront them directly.This is not the time to try to sieze control of things or take the initiative. nor should you move ahead without consulting other people. If you do so, you will only create chaos and confusion. Rather, you should do your best to understand what circumstances require and how can you best adapt to respond to them. To do this, you must put asides your preconceptions and your ego. Keep an open mind. Listen to other people and try and learn from them. Act with generosity and kindness. Put your talents and abilities in the service of others. Seek out friends and helpers to work with. Through devotion, adaptability and careful attention to detail, you can achieve great things. For the text tells us that the receptive, like the dynamic, offers the possibility of supreme success. Receptivity to circumstances is not intertia. It is not the opposite of dynamic action but rather its natural complement. Receptive people follow and adjust to the course of events in the world. They do not try to mold the world to their will or pretend that matters are what they are not. They accept the world as it is and respond to it naturally. They follow the lead of others and consider how to best make a contribution. They assist those who need assistance, they are generous where generosity is required. They put themselves at the disposal of the sittuation so that they can improve it. Although receptive
people do not try to lead or enforce their will, through their resiliance and dedication they nevertheless succed in having the most powerful influence on events. Implicit in receptivness is realism - adapting to things as they are rather than the way we would like them to be. English has a similar metaphor that identifies earth with realism. We say that a realistic person does not have his head in the clouds but is down to earth. This realism is the very oppsite of surrender or capitulation. Indeed, it is the necessary prerequisite to effective action, and to doing what they sittuation truly demands. As the text says, if we set forth blindly, we will soon go astray, but if we follow, we will find guidance from the situation itself. In this way, the situation begins to adapt itself to us even as we adapt ourselves to it. If we do not try to impose willfull preconceptions on the world, it will perpetually surprise us with all manner of possibilities. An attitude of receptivity thus produces a fertility of imagination, which is able to behold a similar fertility in the world itself. Finally, receptivness does not mean conforming to the world resignedly. It means that one acts so as to nurish it. IChingClasses.Kun teaches that through acceptance and adaptability we can redeem what is base and ignoble and make what is good in the world even better. In this way we can bring something to the sittuation, and add peace and prosperity to the world. Instead of trying to dominate or impose our will on those around us, we act as a midwife or assistant, helping others achieve their ends and in this way exerting our influence indirectly, gently, and persistently. IChingClasses.Kun teaches us that one does not have to take the lead in order to have influence, one does not have to be dynamic in order to exercise power, one does not have to be arrogant in order to impress others, and one does not have to be first in everything in order to prevail at the end.

The Image: The basic disposition of Earth is Receptive. Thus the superior person supports all things with his generous virtue.

The Judgement: Shock. Success,Thunder comes - crack, crack! Afterward there is laughter and talk - ha, ha! The shock terrifies for a hundread miles, but he does not let the sacrificial spoon and chalice fail.
JudgementDescription: Something unexpected has shaken you. You had not prepared for it. Suddenly, your life seems in upheval. You experience fear and panic. But once your initial reaction subside, you will recognize that the sudden turn of events is for the best. You have been caught by surprise, but if you hold yourself properly, something positive can and will emerge from the shake-up. The important thing is to stay calm and keep your wits about you. Take a closer look at the sittuation. It is possible that you simply taken on to much. The shocking event may be a blessing in disguise, it gives you an opportunity to reasses your priorities and lessen some of your burdens. Perhaps you have drifted into an unsatisfying and unrewarding routine. The shocking event can awaken you from your lethargy and force you to change your plans. The disruption of your everyday life can invigorate you and give you a fresh outlook on life. It is like the being splashed with cold water. It is unpleasant at first, but it simulates your senses. After the shake-up, you suddenly see new possibilities. Although the change may be disturbing in the beginning, maintain your poise and approach the new sittuation with an open mind. You will come out of this series of events stronger, better, and happier. The book of changes compares the sittuation you now face to thunder pealing while a person is performing a sacred ritual. The shock comes just as the person is ladling out of the sacramental wine. But he is so imbued with seriousness and a sense of purpose that he does not spill a drop. In the same way, you should consider the change as a test of character. If you can maintain equanimity and composure in the face of outside upheval, you are secure against whatever life can throw against you and you will always be able to spot the new potential in changed conditions. That is because the shock not only shakes you up, it also shakes up the world ouside you. New possibilities are created out of the shards of the old. This is a key idea in the book of changes: change- even sudden and startling change, is not only a hazard but an opportunity. People who let shocking events dictate their inner life will be disabled and mored in confusion. They are like people who are struck by lightning. But people who maintain balance in their inner life are quickly to restore balance in their relations with the outside world. They can rise to the challenge and improve their lives in the process.

The Image: Repeated thunder, This is the image of the Shock, in fear and trembling , the superior person examines himself.

The Judgement: Repeated Abyss. If you are truthful and sincere, and follow your heart, then you will have success, and your actions will bring esteem
JudgementDescription: You face a difficult and dangerous situation. You cannot wish it away. You must rise to the challenge and handle the dangers in front of you. Water symbolizes danger, and water also symbolizes the proper way to behave during times of danger. Water is a part of nature and behaves naturally. No matter what happens, it is true to itself. It flows forward without pause. It fills up every place it travels, no matter how lowly. It does not hesitate to move downward in order to move forward. It does not refuse to travel through dangerous places or to take a plunge. It follows its own course, pressing even onward through rocks and ravines until it reachers the calmness of the ocean. In like fashion, when confronted with difficulties, you must be like water: true to yourself, moving forward without hesitation, and not disdaining to do whatever is necessary to push through the dangerous conditions into safety. The text emphasizes truth and sincerity. It says that you can proceed through danger successfully if you are sincere. To be sincere means first that you are not lying to yourslef or deluding yourself. Do not engage in wishful thinking. Accept matters as they are and not as you would like them to be. Equally important, be true to yourself. Understand who you are, what you belive, and what you stand for. Sincerity also means that you are connected to and making use of all your emotional resources. You must summon up all your courage. If you can master yourself, you are in the best possible position to master the sittuation. And once you have gotten in touch with your heart, you will instinctively know what you have to do to survive. Being honest does not mean passimism or despair. Quite the contrary: the lessons of the Book of Changes is that true courage comes from confronting yourself as you are, making use of what you have inside you and not running away from your nature. People who engage in pessimism and self abuse may be as out of touch with reality and with themselves as people who display an excess of pride. If you are sincere, and willing to accept yourself, you will discover that there is much more to you than you imagined. Sincerity means, finally, that you must belive in yourself. Do not lose heart. Stand up for your belifs and maintain your integrity. When chips are down, it is less important what other people think than what you belive. Remain true to your deepest values. To face danger and to face the dissaproval and misunderstanding of others takes courage. But if you are not true to yourself in time of danger, you will lose yourself in time of danger. To succeed in a dangerous situation, you must be thorough and persistent, proceeding without hesitation, like water flowing through a deep ravine. You must do whatever it takes to move past your difficulties. To vacillate when there is work to be done will only increase the perils you face. Like a person traveling through rapids, you must propel yourself forward through the situation in order to reach safety. You must push through, no matter how bad it may seem, for safety lies not where you are but on the other sideee. Danger is a part of life. It cannot be avoided. Like the rapids, we must move through it in order to get to safety. That is why courage is one of the most important values in life. To risk danger may sometimes require physical courage. But the most important asset you can have is emotional courage, the ability to face up to your sittuation and to who you really are. Emotional courage is a form of self- knowledge. That is why the book of changes emphasizes truth and sincerity in times of danger, for one succeds in facing danger through self-knowledge. Danger can clarify your thinking. It can help you understand yourself, what you truly care about, and what you must do. Thus, paradoxically, danger protects as well as threatens: Facing danger makes you stronger if you do not allow yourself to be overwhelmed by it.

The Image: Water flows incessantly toward its goal: this is the image of the abyss repeated. thus the superior person walks in lasting virtue and carries the work of edification.

The Judgement: Keeping Still. He keeps his back still, So that he no longer feels his body, He goes into his courtyard and does not see his people, no blame
JudgementDescription: The Book of Changes teaches that you must both your activity and your rest in harmony with the needs of the situation and the demands of the time. Success comes not only from moving forward at the right time but also from remaining still when it is appropriate to do so. The theme of IChingClasses.Gen is recognizing that the time has come to be still so that you can regain your balance and find peace. The text offers the methaphor of keeping the back still. The back represents the center of your body. Where the back goes the body goes , so if the back remains still, the body will be still. The back is also the location of the spine, hence to make one's back still means to calm the nerves and thus one's mind. When your mind is calm and your thoughts are orderly, it is as if you no longer feel your body - that is, you no longer feel the pain of demands pressing on you from the outside and the urgency of desires pressing on you from the inside. When you are angry and distressed, the world looks disordered and confused. But when you are perfectly calm, you see the world with greater clarity. Being still allows you to see beyond the surface turbulence of life and the petty struggles of the day and look more deeply into the nature of things. Beyond the chaos and commotion lie deeper truths. You recently entered a difficult and trying period. The world seems disordered and confused. In part, that is because you have disorder and confusion within you. The most important thing for you to do right now is to restore your inner balance and find peace of mind. Do not let the chaos and the striving of the outside world distract you or upset you. There is nothing more that you can do in the present sittuation. You have done all you can, any further extertions would only be counterproductive. Because struggling outwardly will do you no good, you should stop struggling inward aswell. Take a deep breath, collect your thoughts, and reflect. You will get nowhere if you obsess about your problems. That will only cause your anexiety to build and build until you feel that you absolutely must do something, and then you are likely to do precisely the wrong thing. If you make your decisions based on worry and apprehension, you are likely to misjudge and exagerate things. But when your mind is still and your emotions are centered, you will make no mistakes. Calm yourself and you will be able to see more deeply into the situation. Then everything will appear in its proper perspective. Being still does not mean abandoning your feelings. Quite the contrary, you will find that you will have a greater intuitive understanding of what is going on. The point is that you can best get in touch with those intuitions through stillness rather than through being in an emotional upheval. And when you connect with those deeper parts of yourself, you will naturally select the right strategies and make the proper choices. You will instinctively know the right thing to do. In this way stillness becomes the necessary predicate for right action in the future.

The Judgement: Gentle influence. Success in small matters. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go. It is beneficial to see a great person.
JudgementDescription: The best way to affect the sittuation right now is through gentle, persistent action and subtle forms of influence. The text compares the right way of proceeding to that of wind. A mild breeze seems inconspicious. But it can penetrate everywhere. Its effects are gradual but are consistent over time. It is delightful and unassuming. Therefore, it is not feared or resisted but is gladly and gratefully accepted. And because it is accepted, it has influence.The key is to be both gentle and persistent. A violent of forceful approach will be counterproductive and meet with a rebuff. But a gentle approach will be more readily and, if you are persistent, will eventually have the right effect. Because you can only influence the sittuation in subtle ways, clarity and singlemindedness of purpose are essential. If you are uncertain about what you want or if you want to waste your time pursuing multiple and conflicting ends, your message will be dissipated and you will have no influence at all. Therefore, you must be absolutely clear in your mind what your goals are. Define your objectives and stick to them. The wind is the most powerful when it blows in one direction. You will not change the situation all at once, but only though steady and persistent influence. Things will proceed slowly, but if you have patience, over time you can have a significant effect. Restrain any impulsive tendencies. Be patient and flexible. Adjust to changing circumstances rather than fighting them, and continually look for opportunities to persuade and win people over to your side. Under no circumstances should you act aggressively or try and dominate the situation. That will surely backfire. Instead, let others take the lead. Stay in the background and serve them. You will make the most progress by subordonating yourself and making your presence felt in small but significant ways.

The Judgement: Radience, It is beneficial to persevere, success, raising a cow brings good fortune
JudgementDescription: The two great themes of IChingClasses.Li and enlightment and interdependece. Fire sheds light on everything as its radiance extends outward, but it burns brightly only as long as it fuel to draw on. As long as fuel lasts, the fire lasts. Whatever gives light, clarifies, and enlightends depends on something else to which it clings, something whose persistence and perseverence allows the light to shine. Hence the text says that in order to be radiant, it is beneficial to persevere. Our brilliance cannot continue long if we do not take care to preserve t he things that allow us to shine. Enlightment means understanding the conditioned and interdependent nature of existancec - how things depend on each other for their being and their continuation. What seems to be self-sustaining and independent actually clings to something else that is the source of its power and preservation. When what supports a thing changes, so too must the thing that depends on it. It is like the flame that clings to its fuel, when the fuel is exhausted, the fire will not last long. We cannot change one element in an interconnected system without changing the other as well, or remove one element without affecting the things that depend on it and on which it depends. If we fail to understand the multiple forms of interdependence in life, the network of interrelated causes and effects, and the existence of synergies and interconnection, we are not truly enlightened. So it is with human life. The life of human beings is not free and independent. It is conditioned on circumstances and, in particular, on other human beings. If you wish to gain clarity in your life, you must understand who and what you depend on and what depends on you. You are never free of everything and everyone . You cling to something just as a fire clings to its fuel. But it is up to you to decide what to cling on. If you cling to what is beneficial and healthy, you will be secure and your life will be well ordered. If you cling to what is disordered and decaying, you will be thrown about as condition change, and your position and your peace of mind will not last long. If you hold onyo thing that are bad for you, or have outlived their usefulness in your life, you are enslaved. But if you cling to what is good and ally yourself with what is beneficient and harmonious, you are free. Human freedom emerges out of unfreedom, out of the spaces created by our conditioned existence and our dependence to others. To realize freedom you must first understand those condition and interdependencies. That is the sense in which enlightment makes a person free. It is not because having understood your sitation you are no longer conditioned or interdependent, it is because you come to understand its hidden possibilities - what can be changed and what cannot. This knowledge allows you to imagine how to capitalize on dependencies and create new synergies. In this way you can achieve success. According to the text, "raising a cow" brings good fortune. The cow symbolizes docilirty, the care of the cow symbolizes nurturance. Enlightment means accepting the world for what it is. recognizing one's connection to others, and taking care of what needs taking care of. This is the path to clarity and peace. Acceptance does not mean resignation. It means facing up to the facts. Only when we accept the world can we begin to work with it to imrpove it and our situation within it. Do not cling to the past, for it is gone and it will not return. Accept change. Be open-minded and adaptable. Don't overreact with anger or despair and don't bury your head in the sand. Don't bemoan your fate. Consider how you can change things for the better, given the situation you now face. Nurture others and you will nurture yourself.

The Judgement: Joy, Success. It is beneficial to persevere 
JudgementDescription: Joy comes from inner peace and inner balance. It requires integrity and strength within and gentleness and acceptance without. Put differently, joy is a matter of character on the one hand and communication on the other. People lack joy because they lack cannot freely communicate with others. Then they are cut off from the pleasures of the shared experience. In the Book of Changes, joy symbolized by two lakes that are joined together. Their waters flow freely into each other and thus replenish each other. Yet although the two lakes freely share with each other, each retains its individual integrity. Joy emerges naturally from freely communicating and sharing experiences with others. It is infectious. If you are cheerful and happy, you will make others feel cheerful and happy as well. And when people are optimistic and outgoing, they share their thoughts and experiences more easily. Reach out to other people in a spirit of goodwill. Let people know that you are interested in what they have to say. Work to create a positive, accepting atmosphere. If you are warm and friendly, people will respond natually and positively. They will be willing to help you and give you the benefit of their perspective. If you try to make people joyous through devious means, or through manipulating them, you may have temporary success. But without the creation of trust and mutual respect, joy cannot last. When people take joy in each other's company, they are willing to make sacrificses for each other. Difficulties seem to melt away. Troubles seem smaller and less threatening than before. When people feel supported and encouraged, they are willing to take on even the most difficult tasks. Thus, joy has enormous power. It brings people together, moves them to do great things and bestows success on their efforts. Joy is not the same as pleasure. The pursuit of pleasure comes from an inward lack, the experience of joy stems from an inner plentitude. Please soon fades and demands repeated stimulation to be re-created and sustained. Joy required nothing outside of itself. Try to run after joy and you will not get it. Joy must come from within. It is the product of inner peace and emotional stability. A person who is not balanced inwardly will not find that balance externally. You cannot depend on other people to make you happy, or rely on things to fulfill you. That is simply a recipie for frustration. Whenever your happiness depends on the acumulation of things or the approval of other people, you have no real security. You are at the mercy of forces beyond your control. You will continually be anxious and fearful that what you have will be taken away from you or that you will never get what you think you need to be complete. Instead, take a different approach. If you want to take joy in the outside world, you must first learn to find some joy in your heart. Make peace with yourself. Stop chasing after things in order to prove that you are worthy of love. Instead, devote yourself to something that nourishes and replenishes you.Stop looking outside yourself for the key to your happiness or for the confirmation of your self-worth. You have everything within yourself that you need in order to be happy. Accept life for what it is and accept yourself for who you are. Have a little faith in yourself and your abilities. Learn to share with other people and have fun doing so. Then you wont have to look outside yourself for joy. You will find that is already within you.

The Image: Lake attached to each other. This is the image of joy Thus the superior person join with friends for discussion and practice.

Keywords: Pushing up out of the ground, growing pains, birth throes, birth pangs, initial difficulties, time to gather helpers
The Judgement: Difficulty in the beginning, Supreme success, It is beneficial to persevere, Do not use this as an opportunity to undertake anything, it is beneficial to establish feudal lords
JudgementDescription: To undertake something means to engage in something ambitious. In ancient China, rulers granted lands and titles to feudatories in exchange for their promise of help and support, and in particular promises of military assistance when the ruler was attacked. Hence "to establish feudal lords" means to seek help from others during a difficult time. You face a situation akin to growing pains. A new era is beginning. Things are struggling to take form. Chaos is slowly and painfully being converted into the first semblance of a new order. This confusion may reside in your projects and undertakings, in your own thoughts and desires, or even in your relationships with others. You may find what you one thought was settled and clear has now become unsettled and uncertain. You may be questioning old assumptions and belifs, although you are not yet quite sure what to replace them with. You are leaving the confines of the safe and familiar and moving to a new frontier of inderterminate scope and abundent possibilities. Indeed, there are so many possibilities now that you may find yourself adrift and confused. But the current lack of form brings the promisse of ultimate success, for there is much potential here. Nevertheless, precisely because things are still so unsettled, you must not act prematurely or attempt any great undertakings. This is not the time to be overly ambitious. Rather, you must move slowly and carefully, feeling your way about and beginning to consolidate your position. You could benefit greatly from the help and advice of other people during this difficult time. Do not be too proud to ask for assistance. Look to people more experienced than yourself to advise you. They will help you sort out your thoughts and priorities.

Keywords: Innocence, Ignorance, Immaturity, Youthful folly, Wisdom not yet revealed, The young shoot, begginer's luck
The Judgement: Youthful Inexperience. Success. It is not who seek the ignorant youth. The ignorant youth seeks me. It is beneficial to persevere. 
JudgementDescription: IChingClasses.Meng describes a situation in which you have limited experience and do not know how to deal with the sittuation before you. Whether you realize it or not, you need to seek help. But instruction is useless unless the pupil understands the need for instruction and is genuinely willing to learn. That is why the text says that the teacher does not seek the youth, the youth must seek the teacher. Conversely, if you have been approached for help, remember that you cannot teach a person who is not yet ready to listen and learn. Do not be ashamed to admit that the complications in the situation are beyond your ken and that you do not know all the answers. Rather, try to see this as an opportunity to expand your vision and experience. Open your mind and put aside preconceptions and prejudices. Remember that your goal is to learn, to to show off what you already know. Combine eagerness to learn with modesty and humility. In this way you will maximize the benefits of your education. If you express a desire to learn and seek out people you trust and respect, the results will be positive. Once you have begun the course of instruction, neither you nor your teacher should give up until you have thoroughly mastered the information you need. Successful education requires not only the initial assimilation of material but also the development of good habits and consistency of effort. Hence the text says, "it is beneficial to persevere". Another traditional interpretation of IChingClasses.Meng is that you already know what you must do in the current situation, but you not like the answer. Such unwillingness to face reality is a form of close-mindness and hence in its own way an inability to learn from experience. Knowing wehat is the case and pretending that it is otherwise, or recognizing what has to be done and refusing to accept it is truly a manifestation of folly. If you know the answer to your question, there is no point in asking the Book of Changes for a different answer. Many commentators read the text literally: they suggest that you will eventually recive the hexagram IChingClasses.Meng if you ask the Book of Changes the same question repeatedly after getting an answer you do not like. Receiving IChingClasses.Meng is the books way of rebuking you for pestering it when it already given you an answer. This standard interpretation is fanciful but dubious since there is no evidence that IChingClasses.Meng is more likely to appear through random selection than is any other hexagram. A better interpretation of the text is more consistent with the hexagram's general theme: IChingClasses.Meng teaches that one cannot learn the truth until one is ready to receive the truth.

The judegement: Waiting. Sincerity and faithfulness bring shining success. Perseverance brings good fortune. It is beneficial to cross the great river
The judgement description: Because of circumstances beyond control, you must wait patiently. You cannot take direct action at present. Nevertheless, you must have faith that things will work out for the best eventually. Just as we cannot force the rain to fall, we cannot force the propitious circumstances for action. Instead, we must let them come to us, just as the rain will eventually come and replenish and nourish the earth. There are two kinds of waiting: the apprehensive waiting of the weak and the calculated waiting of the strong. The weak person wait out of the fear and despair, becomes increasingly filled with anexiety and agitation and so finally plunges ahead at the wrong time with disastrous results. In contrast, the strong person waits because waiting is the best way to maximize the chances of eventual success. Such calculated waiting is a sign of strenght, not weakness, of assurance, not resignation, of competence, not deficiency. While the weak person waits ever fearful that matters will spin out of control, the strong person waits knowing that success in inevitable, and all the elements for success will appear when the time is right.
Calculated waiting is not merely a matter of hope for better days. It is a matter of faith, faith in the ultimate success of your endeavors, and equally important, faith in yourself. You must belive that you are going to succeed and yhat you deserve to. You must visualize success in your mind's eye. You must belive the narrative of your eventual triumph. Then your faith will unconciously adapt to your actions to maximize your chances. Hence the text says, "Sincerity and faithfulness bring shining success".The power of faith provides allows a person to preserve in even the most difficult endevors, symbolized by crossing the great river. Just because you are waiting does not mean that there is nothing to do. First and foremost, you must try to understand the sittuation objectively. Your faith must be nourished by realism. You will prevail only if you can develop the neccessary inner strength and self-confidence to meet the conditions that actually exist, and to do this, you must be uncompromizingly honest with yourself. Only when you face the sittuation as it is without self-deception or illusion will you be able to see what holds you back and what you must do to prevail. At this point, the way forward will slowly emerge, the light of your inner truth will gradually illuminate the path to success. Make all the necessary preparations. Do not cut corners and do not take half measures. When and only when the time is right, you must go forward with tenacity. Along the way you will inevitabily experience doubts about whether you have what it takes to succeed. Put them aside. Keep your ultimate goal ever before you. When the time has come to act, you must be resolute and preserving. Go out to meet your fate with determination, with faith and with courage. Then you will get what you seek.

The judgement: In conflict, be sincere. Be prudent in dealing with obstruction, to halt halfway brings good fortune, to carry things though to the end brings misfortune, It is beneficial to see a great person, it is not beneficial to cross the great river
The judgement description: Conficts arise when two people believe that they are right and their interests become opposed. This may be because the parties have not been communicating with eachother effectively or because they no longer trust each other. And if the parties are strangers, then they have never had the chance to communicate or develop trust. Thus if you wish to understand conflict, you must understand its beginnings. If you do not believe that you are in the right, you should not become involved in conflict. This is true both as a moral and a practical matter. If you do not believe in yourself asnd in the justness of your cause, you will not win a fight with a determined opponent. Indeed, you should never go into combat without a sincere commitment to success and without understanding your goals in advance. Conflict is a matter or values, not a matter of force. If uou do not fight to vindicate values that you believe in, there is no point in going forward/ Even if you have superior strength, domniating another when you know that you are wrong does not mean that you've won. It only means that you debased yourself though the use of violence and trickery. "Be prudent in dealing with obstruction" means that you should not rush into conflicts thoughtlessly. Because a struggle destroys the resources of both parties, it is always better to explore how a direct confruntation can be avoided. Try to adjust matters and reach a settlement before conflicts grow and get out of hand. Open up lines of communication and try to establish trust and reciprocity. Attempting to reach accomodation keeps each side from wasting valueable capital and may even produce unexpected synergies. Nevertheless, some things are simply worth fighting for, and if there is no other choice, conflict becomes a necessity. Indeed, conflict and a show of strength is sometimes necessary as a prerequisite to later agreement. If you find yourself in a conflict, remain calm and collected. A conflict is a potentially dangerous situation. Iy can easily spin out of control if you do not pay careful attention. Having entered into it, you must find a way out of it. The most aggressive approach is not always the best one. You should first decide what you want to achieve and what you will accept as a satisfactory ending to the conflict. Unless you know what your goals are, you will not be able to plan an effective strategy. By prolonging conflict without a clear plan or direction, you may destroy something very valuable in the process - not only what belongs to your adversary, but what belongs to yourself. Once you have begun a conflict with another, you must have the inner strength and confidence to settle your dispute and meet your opponent halfway. Often this requires courage every bit as great as the courage to fight on. The secret of success in conflict is not the ability to prevail. It is the ability to compromise. If you cannot compromise, every conflict must become either an ignominous defeat or a fight to death. But if you have the ability to compromise, you can turn a deadly conflict into a potential of growth and improvment. Nevertheless, you will be able to reach an effective compromise only when you know what your own values and goals truly are and what you will be willinng to give up in order to get them. If you are confused about what you want, you will find it difficult to end a conflict without great loss. That is why the text says that in conflict you must be sincere. You must be honest with yourself at each stage of the process in getting into the conflict, in carrying the conflict forward , and in getting out of it. Compromise becomes possible precicely because conflicts are conflicts of value as well as conflicts of interests and resources. By learning to respect and understand your opponent's values, you can find your way to a solution. The most successful compromises are those in which each side feels that it has gained something important or that some elements of its cause have been recognized and vindicated. Even if you are convinced that you are in the right, you must know when to stop halfway. Even if compromise is not possible, you will have to let go at some point. If you fight to the bitter end, you will not only use up your resources but you will also create lasting enmity. Words once spoken and blows once struck cannot be taken back. It's easier to forgive a minor skirmish than a bloodbath. And if you fight to the bitter end, you may so weaken yourself that the victory you gain is not worth the cost. Because conflict can be so destructive to all sides, it is important to put your disputes before a neutral arbiter that both parties can trust. Hence the text says that should "see a great person", not merely for advice but to help end the conflict. The legitimacy and authority of an arbiter - whether a person or an insitution - all low the parties to settle the dispute and save face. Quite literally, it allow them to have their day in court - to state fully and publicly the nature of their grievance and have it considered fully and fairly by a neutral third party, even if they do not ultimately win the day. The ability of both parties to be heard and heard equally is an important feature of a just legal system. Finally, the text advises that when you are engaged in conflict, you should not "cross the great river", that is, you should not attempt singnificant new undertakings, start new projects, or make major life changes until the conflict is satisfactory resolved. Conflicts drain both pgysical and emotional resources. If your attention is divided on several fronts, you weaken yourself and make it more difficult to prevail in any aspect of your life. Similarly, to win a conflict in the outside world you must not be comflicted inside. If you wand your allies are at odds, or if you are divided within yourself, you lessen the chances of successful compromise or ultimate victory.
The image: Heaven and water go their opposite ways: this is the image of conflict, thus in all his affairs the superior person carefully considers how things begin.

The judgement: The army needs perseverance and a strong leader. Good fortune
The judgement description: A mass of people is not an army, but it can become one if its trained, organized, and led by a great general. Discipline is curcial. It converts a disorganized mob into an effective fighting force. But discipline is not achieved through threats or violence. Rather it requires leadership. Good generals know how to inspire their troops and create a sense of esprit de corps. They know how and when to exercise authority and punish disobedience, to enourage resourcefulness and reward ambition. They train their troops so thoughly that discipline and obedience become second nature, and then organize and arrange them so that their force and effect is amplified and maximized. Grteat generals always show care and concern for the welfare of their soldiers. They understand the destructiveness of war and therefor risk the lives of their soldiers only when it is necessary to do so. They are bold when the situation requires it but hold back when it is prudent. They use force sparingly and with precision. And because they are loyal and honorable to those who serve beneath them, their troops willingly follow them into battle. Just as troops are loyal to good generals, good generals are loyal and trustworthy to their king and country. Hence rulers have complete confidence in their military leaders and give them the responsability to conduct the war to its conclusion.
The same considerations apply to all effective leadership. Any organization needs a strong leader who knows how to gain the trust of others and inspire them with a sense of vision and common purpose. You must be able to convey your sense of enthusiasm and commitment to others, and you must recognize the importance of planning, organization and discipline. Exert your authority fairly and consistently and you will win the respect and obedience of others. Act loyally and honorably to others if you want them to act loyally and honorably to you. The army is also a metaphor for the conduct of your life. You are both the potential army and the general who must train it and transform it from a disorganized mass of peasantry into a disciplined and motivated force. Like the general, you are entrusted with great possibilities. But like the undifferentiated mass, your ambitions will amount to nothing if you do not establish priorities and organize and structure your life. If you want to succeed, you must have clear-cut goals and you must be enthusiastic about them. Otherwise you will not have the courage to persevere when you meet opposition. Discipline yourself and your desires so that healthy and effective habits become second nature. Marshal your forces and abilities and put them to the best possible use. In the same way, apply the basic elements of good military strategy to your life. Once you have settled on your goals, decide what course of action will be most likely to achieve them, and pursue them with steadfast determination. Be resourceful and open to new solutions. Make no rash assaults but instead move forwardly only when you have carefully planned everything in advance and have fully considered the consequences of your actions. Seek all available intelligence and information and carefully consider the correct terrain in which to act. Put yourself in the right place as to maximize your effectivness. In dealing with others, adopt the military virtues of honor, loyality asnd integrity. Finally, treat yourself and your resources with the same degree of care that a wise general would treat his own troops. Do not enlist in reckless sallies and do not engage in self-destructive behavior. Repsect yourself and behave toward yourself as someone who is worthy of loyalty and honor. Have the courage to maintain faith in yourself and your aspirations. Follow the principles of a great general and you will help ensure your victory in the long run.

Keywords: Joining in with others, Joining in, Rallying around a leader
The judgement: Union. Good fortune. Look deep down inside yourself and divine. Whether you have greatness, perseverence, and constancy, for there will be no blame, those who lack peace gradually come from all sides. Those who arrive too late meet with misfortune.
The judgement description: The theme of Bi is unity with other people, and one's relationships to individuals and groups. Successful unions can help all of their members grow as individuals and prosper. But they also require that people be willing to cooperate and work for each other's good rather than for their own selfish interests. People must also believe that they have something in common if the union is to succeed. You should not join a group if you do not feel connected and committed to others and do not share their values and belifs. Joining in because you can think of nothing better to do or because other people are doing so is a recipie for eventual estragement, disillusionment, and unhappiness. But if the relationship is right, joining in will be good for your own growth and self-development. Your contributions to the group will be recognized, and all of the members will mutually support eachother. Unity is more than coming together, it also requires holding perople together over the long run, and dealing with the stresses and strains, the difficulties and disagreements that inevitably arise in the group. Holding people together required leadership - a central person or figure whom others depend on and around whom people can unite. Being the center of a group carries great responsibilities. It requires that you have magnanimity, vision, inner strength, perservereance, and constancy. If you are called upon to take the responsibility of forming a group or keeping it toghether, the text advises that you look deep inside yourself to see whether you have these important qualities. If you take up a leadership role without a genuine sense of commitment or without a sense of being truly called to the task, you may only create confusion and chaos and you will stand in the way of others who could forge a successful union. When a group forms around a common project, ideal, or value, it naturally attracts other who want to share in the vitality and happiness of a sucessful union. As the text says, people who are at first hesitant to make a commitment gradually take heart and join in from all sides. The power of a healthy union is that it can inspire others and ive them something to belive in when they are full of confusion or self-doubt. If you are contemplating joining a group that you think is right for you, do not take long. People form strong bonds and alliances through their shared experiences in a group. If you join in too late, those connections will already be in place and you will have missed being a part of the formative influences that give a group it's identity. You may feel like an outsider, and you may find it difficult or even impossible to fully intergrate into the group and feel fully a part of it.

Although this may be frustrating, you should maintain a realistic attitude. Even though the barriers to progress seem minor, and frustratingly trivial, do not underestimate them. Exercise caution.

Instead, do all that you can do now to prepare in small ways for the eventual breakthrough. Pay careful attention to everyday questions. Be meticulous and painstaking in your efforts. Plan ahead for future. Gather information and discuss the situation with others. Accumulate whatever small advantages you can. Do not threaten or coerce others or order them around to get your way. Instead, try to influence people through gentle persuation and friendly behavior. In this way you can act as a partial restraint on their behavior if they are contemplating something unwise.

People in different areas of life have lost touch with each other, social relations have broken down, and disorder proliferates. The time is truly out of joint. Because people cannot cooperate, they cannot make progress. Because people pursue only their narrow self-interest and regard everyone else as rivals and enemies, harmony and reciprocity wither away. In a time of standstull, petty and inferior people are on the rise. Their bad habbits, small mindedness, selfishness and meannness poison the atmosphere of social life.

They should not count on the assistance of intolerant, shallow, and fawning people, for the latter seek only to maximize their own glory and power.

The judgement description: The best way to realize your goals now is through participation in a group. You can achiece great influence and success through a collective endeavor. The group may be your friends, or it may be a political group, a social club, a religious organization, or the people you work with everyday. If you are willing to join in with likeminded people, you can acomplish much more than you ever could on your own. For a group to succed, people need to feel they have a common purpose and that the members are commited to eachother. Trust and reciprocity are essential ingredients to success. The text speaks of fellowship even in the open fields. Fields are a metaphor for what is far and wide, broad and distant. Thus fellowship even in the open fields means fellowship that is maintained through thick and thin, and that can extend to all sorts of people who possess common values and goals. A sense of commitment and shared devotion make it possible for a group to achieve important and ambitious tasks, symbolized by being able to cross the great river. If you find a gruop with whom you can identify and whose values you admire, give your support without reservation. If others see that you are earnest and sincere, they will be willing to join in as well. Over time, groups are subjected to many stresses and strains. The important thing is to let everyone in the group feel that they are needed and that their contributions are valued. If you take advantage of people or treat them in condencesion, they will not be willing to give their all for the group, and they will be more likely to abandon the enterprise in times of hardship. Whatever your position in the fellowship or organization, be open minded and willing to listen to others. Keep the communication lines open not only preserves harmony and stability over time, but it also helps the groups achieve its goals more effectively. The collective intelligence of many people working on a single project is often more powerful and thorough than of any single individual, not matter how talented. Individual efforts and skills become greater than the sum of their parts when they are brought together in a common endeavor.

Whatever you undertake now has the greatest chance of success. Your relationships with others will blossom and thrive your resources multiply. Becausse you have so much going your way, you are effectively in command of the sittuation. Therefore, the time of great possesion is also a time of soverignity and control over your life.

Nevertheless, the lesson of this hexagram is that when you are in such a commanding position you must remain modest and unassuming. Then, your success will not alarm or threaten others. Hence peopel will be willing to gather around and cooperate with you. Put another way, in the time of great possesion, one needs great progress, gather increased support, and draw even more resources to your side.

By expressing your influence and your authority in subtle, controlled and graceful ways, you help ensure continued successes and prosperity not only for yourself but for those who ally themselves with you. A time of great possesion should also be a time of great clarity and enlightment. When you have so much going on for you, it is important to remain true to your principles. Use this time to pursue something truly worthy. You now have the chance to change your life for the better, so make sure to use this opportunity to move in the right direction. If you cannot live your life according to your highest aspirations and values when things are going well, when else will you be able to do so?

Keywords: humility, humbleness, moderation, temperance, maintaining a balanced attitude, fullfilling ones duties, carrying things through to completion
The judgement: Modesty, Success, The superior person carries things through the end
The judgement description: According to the book of changes, modesty is one of the most important virtues. It is not innate but rather is the product of long, continous and concious self-development and self-cultivation. It differs from Christian ideal of meekness iun important respects. Modesty does not mean submissivness or passivity. A modest person may be quite active in the world, working steadily and unobtrusively, making commitments and living up to them. The text says that the modest person carries things through their conclusion. Why is this attitude modest? It is because modest people do not think they are more important than the work that they perform or the commitment that they have made to others. Therefore, they are consistent and reliable. Modest people do not regard anything that they must do as beneath them. Therefore, their pride does not get in the way of their success. They put their work, their obligations, and their commitments before their egos. That is why they are able to prevail in the long run. Thus, modesty does not imply inaction. Rather, it means acting positively, cooperatively, and harmoniously. It means respecting other people and treating them as equals. By contrast, proud people think they are better than everyone else or act as if they were. Often their pride hides a deeper insecurity. But truly modest people know who they are and therefore do not need to engage in pretension in order to impress others. Conversely, they do not think of others as beneath them, they treat other people with the inherent dignity that all people deserve. Thus modesty means being intolerant and accepting rather than haught or judgemental. The virtue of modesty is connected to the principles of yin and yang underlying the philosophy of the book of changes. Whatever is extended too far will eventually be contracted and diminished, conversely, whatever is modest will eventually be expanded and increased. People envy and fear what is to great to powerful and seek to undermine it, but they do not feel threatened by what is lowly and humble and so they treat it with kindness and affection. By adopting the virtues of humility and modesty you make it easier for people to accept you and cooperate with you to your mutual advantage. And by not pushing things too far you avoid pride and overreaching that might bring about a fall.
The image: In the middle of the earth there is a mountain, this is the image of modesty, thus the superior person lessens what is too much, and increases what is too little. he weighs things and makes their distribution equal.

Keywords: Stirring up, Insipiring, Broadcasting, Undertaking, Preparing for, planning ahead, enjoyment, delight
The judgement: Enthusiasm, it is beneficial to establish feudal lords and set armies in motion
The judgement description: This hexagram has two meanings. On the one hand, it means to make preparations for future action. On the other hand, it means to stir up enthusiasm and delight in one's self and in other people. Taken together, the message is that if you make proper arrangements early on and provide for things in advance, you can feel free to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labors later without concern or guilt. You may justifiable take delight in what you have put in place and set in motion. Conversely, if you are trapped in inertia, indolence, or deluded satisfaction, you cannot make plans for the future. To take precautions and to work for the future, a person needs to be stimulated and motivated. That is why preparation is the flip side of enthusiasm. The words of the hexagram judgment reflect this duality: establishing feudal lords is a matter of prior preparation. One creates feudatories because one will need their support someday. On the other hand, to set armies in motion is a matter of inspiring the troops to action after one has made the proper preparations. In like fashion, you should anticipate your needs and gather people around you who can help you achieve your aims. The traditional metaphor of enthusiasm in the Book of Changes is music. The metaphor of music simultaneously captures the notions of delight, harmony, inspiration, and sympathy between people. The vibration of one string brings symphatetic vibrations from others. Sounds resonate with other sounds, harmonies blend, fundamentals produce overtones. Moreover music exemplifies how to stir people up and get them to act as one. Music is the great unifier. Catchy melodies and vigorous drumbeats cause people to sing and move their bodies in unison. Music joins the spirits of many individuals into one great spirit, rythms transport bodies and souls towards a single goal. If you want to inspire others, you must first have symathy with them. You must be like a string on a musical instrument that resonates with other strings. To motivate people you must adjust and adapt yourself so that you are in harmony with their needs and their values. Great leaders and teachers inspire because they understand and are in harmony with the tenor of their times. They are able to lead people because they follow the people's spirit and act in accord with it. Nothing significant and lasting can be acomplished and no laws can be effectively enforced, unless it is in accord with popular sentiment. Second, you can inspire no one if you are not yourself inspired. If you have confidence and enthusiasm, you can do a great deal, without them you can do very little. To bring people together for a common purpose, you must feel reused and a motivatated to do something important. Following the calling of your heart will create a natural and spontanous response in others. Do not be afraid to be passionate about what is truly important to you. Your inspiration will draw able helpers to your side. This is how great masses of people are unified and how they achieve victory. Third, you must combine your passiopn with preparation and hard work. Thomas Edison once said that genious is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. The same is true of stirring people up to something great. It is not enough simply to arouse passions momentarily. The groundwork for inspiration must be carefully laid. That is why music is so apt a symbol of this hexagram. Great musicians inspire and ennoble us, but their ability to do so is the result of years of hard work and practice at their craft. Music is the perfect example of the preparation that results in a seemingly spontaneous inspiration and connection with a higher power. As it is in music, so it is in life, creativity and improvisation are made possible by prior development, instinct is the child of practice, spontaneity is the residue of design. 
The image: Thunder rises out of the earth, this is the image of enthusiasm, thus the kind of old made music, to rouse the spirits and inspire virtue, they offered it in splendor to worship the supreme diety, so that they might be worthy of their illstrious ancestors

IChingClasses.Sui
------------------
Above: lake, below: thunder
Number: 17
Keywords: following, allegiance, loyality, hunting, pursuits, adaptability, being adaptable
The judgement: Following. Supreme success. It is beneficial to be constant and steadfastly faithful. No blame
The judgement description: IChingClasses.Sui concerns the obligations of followers and leaders - how to get others to follow you and when and how to follow others. If you want other to follow you, you must know how to adjust yourself to them. In the words of the old Chineese proverb, to rule is to serve. No one can be a true leader who does not have sympathy for those in one's charge. You must adapt yourself to the demands of the time and the needs of your supporters. Then you will gain the respect and trust of others so that they follow you with joy and gladness. If you try to gain mastery over other people through force and fraud, or through conspiracy and connivance, you will poison social relations and breed resentment and resistence. At most you will gain control only of a fraction that must surpress its opponents. If you wil power through injuring others, you will have to keep injuring them to maintain your base. The injuries you do to thers will not fade away, they will haunt you later on. On the other hand, if you gain power through winning the trust and affection of others, they will give you the benefit of the doubt when you must take tough decisions that you feel are in the interest of all. When your leadership is established on trust rather than fear, you maintain your base of support by continuing to work on behalf of those who follow you. They in turn will support your endeavors, and in this way everyone will benefit. Conversely, if you are in the position of following others, you must make sure that you are doing so for the right reasons. Hence the text warns you to be constant and steadfastly faithful. One can be only faithful in this way to principles that last for a long time rather than to fads and fashions that come and go. If you follow a group because it is currently powerful and influential, you are not really following anything but your own ambition and your own need for approval. But if you follow a group or leader because of the quality of its belifs and goals, and not merely to advance your own selfish interests, you will be without blame. IChingClasses.Sui has a dual meaning. It means both to follow something and to pursue it. Thus, IChingClasses.Sui also concerns the deeper question of what you should persue in life. The answer to this question, is deceptively simple to state but often difficult to put into practice: first of all, you must follow your conscience. Second, you must follow what gives happiness. In the hexagram IChingClasses.Sui, IChingClasses.Zhen - the symbol of the Arouding, follows IChingClasses.Dui. So should you. Life is to short to squander on things that are unrewarding. Devote yourself to things that will enrich you and give meaning to your life. Aim high. If you settle for less than the best, you will almost certainly get it. Just because you pursue something valuable does not mean that you will attain it imediately and without effort. Nothing worth having is attained so easily. You must cultivate the virtues of patience and flexibility. IChingClasses.Sui teaches that you can achieve great success if you know how to adapt your efforts to the demands of the time. Indeed, this is a central theme of Book of Changes. Be open-minded and willing to learn. Instead of exhausting your energies in vain struggles against the world, try to see how you can make progress by moving in different directions. Be willing to experiment. Take a fresh view of the sittuation. Overcome old prejudices and try new ways of doing things. Flexibility without and persistence within will bring you to your goal.

IChingClasses.Gu

Number: 18
Keywords: working on what has been spoiled, decay, repair, restoration
The judgement: Remedying what has been spoiled, supreme success, it is beneficial to cross the great river
The judgement description: Although the theme if IChingClasses.Gu is decay, the hexagram also symbolizes the possibility of hope. IChingClasses.Gu is concerned not so much with the natural forces of decay, as with the decay that comes through bad habbits and unwise choices. Such decay results from inertia, carelessness, muddled thinking, selfishness, and lack of discipline. In order to remedy this decay, you must adopt the opposite traits, energetic activity, careful preparation, thoughtful deliberation, determination, and commitment. What has gone wrong though mistake, lassitude, or inaction, can be repaired through self-discipline, commitment, energy, and enterprise. IChingClasses.Gu thus symbolizes both the inevitable weaknesses and shortcomings of human will that cause conditions to decline and the abundant potential of human freedom that can bring about renewal and recovery. This is a message of hope, the text tells us that working to repair what has become stagnant promises supreme success. That is why it is worth "crossing the great river", that is, undertaking something difficult and arduous. Something is going wrong in your life. It may be your environment or it may be your own habits and attitudes. The problem is the legacy of previous bad choices. It has existed for some time, although you may not have realized it. Its origins lie in past actions or inaction, mistakes of judgement and missed opportunities. Even so, you now have the ability to do something about it. You can start anew. But you must make the effort to do so. Inertia is a big reason why things have come to this state. If you let things slide, the problem will not go away. Indeed, the situation will only get worse. Success in rememdying what has been spoiled requires, first of all, that you ascertain what has gone wrong and why. You must ask yourself how things got this way. In order to do this you will have to face the situation honestly. You may have to confront unpleasant and unresolved issues in your life or your environment, and you may have to acknowledge features of the situation that you previously neglected, denied, or hid from yourself. The task calls for deliberation and self-examination. This may be emotionally difficult, but gaining insight is essential to success. Hence the text says "before starting, three days", meaning that before you must take the time to understand the source of the problem so that you can devise an appropriate remedy. You should not be afraid to act for fear of doing the wrong thing, but you should exercise caution and restraint at the beginning. Seek advice from people you trust. Do not be to proud to ask for help. Once you have started working to repair the sittuation, spend some time evaluating what you have done. Ask yourself: if the new strategy working? Does it need to be readjusted? That is why the text says, after starting, three days. After you begin reforms, your actions must be guided by continous investigation and deliberation. In this way you will avoid falling back into bad old habbits. Above all, have courage. Maintain faith in yourself no matter how difficult making the necessary changes may be at the beginning. If you persevere and remain determined to see things through, your efforts will be rewarded.

Keywords: Approach, Oversight, Cooperation
The judgement: Overseeing. Supreme success. It is beneficial to persevere. When the eight month comes, there will be missfortune
The judgement description: By tradition, IChingClasses.Lin is a symbol of springtime. More generally, it symbolizes happy joyous times of natural progress and advancement, like the first stirrings of spring. The low advance upward to the high, who happily accept them. Matters move forward naturally. Relationships thrive. Success blossoms like the flowers of spring. However, just like growth during springtime, everything must take its natural course. Do not try to hurry things, let matters develop in a normal and healthy fashion. Full growth is not achieved in the springtime but in the summertime. Thus, you should not become impatient, success will come eventually if you lay strong foundations now and if you nurture things appropiately. Energy and initiative are important during this time. Make the most of opportunities for growth when they present themselves. This is an especially fertile period, so be on the lookout for ways to improve your situation and your relationships with others. When things are going well for you, remember to share your good fortune. Consider how your actions will affect others. Encourage people who work under you and help them advance. Think of them like young plants in spring time that need to be tended and helped so that they will grow upward and become healthy, beautiful, and strong. Finally, remember that spring does not last forever. The good times will eventually evaporate, so it is important to make the most of them while they last. Hence the text says: in "the either month"-september in chineese calendar, there will be misfortune, because summer is fading away and autumn is approaching. For this reason it is important to nip problems in the bud before they have a chance to grow large. Keep your eyes open for early signs of difficulty or deterioration. If you make the effort now, you will be in a much stronger position when you face obstacles in the future. Take advantage of this favorable time to establish the groundwork for future success.

Above: wind, below: kun
Number: 20
Keywords: observation, contemplation, serving as an example, taking an overview, understanding, self-examination, spiritual connection, inner clarity leads to successful action in the world
The judgement: Viewing, The ablution has been made, but not yet offering, filled with trust and sincerity, they are reverent and dignified.
The judgement description: The text describes a religious ceremony in ancient China in which the leader first pours out a ritual libation and then makes a sacrifice in front of the people. The text focuses on the magical moment between these two acts, when all attention is focused on the leader, religious reverence and spiritual contemplation are at their height. In the book of changes, guan is metaphor for contemplation. Contemplation does not mean turning away from the world. Rather it means taking the time to understand the workings of the universe, one's own nature, and one's place in a world of continuity and change. Contemplation is more than the acumulation of bits of knowledge, more than the assimilation and memorization of true factual propositions. It is a profoundly spiritual practice. Through opening one's self to hidden realities and to the possibilities latent in the world, the self is transformed. People who are able to contemplate themselves and the world with utter clarity are thereby imbued with the power to change themselves and the world. Their understanding gives them an uncanny spiritual force that naturally emanates from them and influences others. Sensing the power of their thought, others look up to them and follow them. This is the connection between looking and being looked up to, between contemplation and serving as an example for others. It is the connection between inner truth and outward effect. The challenge you face now is to take a new look at the sittuation. Put aside older ways of imagining things and take a broader view. Be open minded and not allow your emotions to cloud your judgement. Try to face reality as it is and not as you might want it to be. Stop thinking about things from the standpoint of how they affect you personally and try to see the larger picture. Consider the origins of things and how matters arrived at the present state. This is a time to learn and to expand possibilties. If you can approach the situation with complete clarity and dispassion, you will be able to see the direction in which events are moving. And if you are willing to embrace the truth, whatever it might be, you will gain enormous power and influence in the long run. Do not be too concerned if people do not listen to you at first. As people recognize your commitment to the truth and the clarity of your thought, they will come around. Knowledge is not simply a collection of true statements. It is a social practice and a terrain of power. The force of conformity is very strong. Many people compromise their belifs and alter their understandings in order to fit in. And many others use their knowledge not for the good of mankind but to sieze the power and manipulate others in the short run. Do not follow this path. The right kind of influence will accrue to you only if you maintain your integrity.

Above: fire, below: thunder

Keywords: Reform, Acting decisively, administering punishments, doing justice
The judgement: Biting through. Success. It is beneficial to do justice
The judgement description: This hexagram traditionally represented criminal penalties, or recourse to law in order to enforce justice. More generally, Shih He concerns the need for energetic reform. The basic metaphor of the hexagram is a person who bites through and obstruction. When there is danger of significant deterioration or lasting injury, vigorous action is necessary to do justice and restore proper conditions. Something has gone wrong. It may be a a transgression or an injustice. Someone may be taking advatage of you. Or you may have fallen prey to bad habits. Whatever the cause of the situation, reform is imperative. You must take a firm stand now. Things must change. Half measures will not do. You must cut through to the heart of the sittuation and approach it with complete clarity. Then when you understand what needs to be done, you must act. This is no time to be meek and pliant. Attack the problem with energy and determination. If you do not act quickly and decisively, the problem will not go away, and it may only become worse. Nevertheless, this does not mean that you should be reckless. Prompt and eficient action is necessary, but your action should be based on clear thinking rather than emotion. And it should be the result of careful planning rather than blind instinct. The best approach now is one that is firm but reasonable, fair but resolute.
The image: Thunder and lightning. This is the image of biting through. Thus the ancient kings enforced the laws. Through clearly defined penalties.

Bi - Adornment
-----------------
Above: IChingClasses.Gen, mountain Below: li fire
Number: 22
Keywords: Grace, beauty, persuation, ornamentation, simplicity, inner beauty
The judgement: Adornment. Success. In small matters it is beneficial to undertake something
The judgement description: Adornment brings success as a small thing. It smooths the path of life and makes it more bearable. When adornment becomes the central thing, it can easily become perverted because it is placed above other human values and human needs. Nevertheless, the study of beauty helps us understand the profundity of the world. Through the contemplation of beauty and form, we discover both the demands of a particular time and the power of the unchanging. And through attention to how beauty is produced, we apprehend the connection between outr form and inner nature. The beauty of a fire or a mountain range is the natural product of the processes that give rise to these things. It is the same in human life. The Book of Changes teaches that outer beauty should emerge as a natural product of inner beauty. Then adornment does not simply cover or disguise a person's nature but becomes its organic expression. In practical terms, Bi signifies that you cannot exert great influence on the situation. But you can have a positive effect in small ways. But you can have a positive effect in small ways. Behave with tact and consideration to others. For the time being, you must accept aspects of the sittuation that you do not like, but you can make progress at the periphery if you act with charm and grace. Work on polishing your appearance and your powers of persuation. Brush up your talents. Smooth out the rough edges in your life and in your relationships with others. This is a good time to improve your habits of communication and self expression. Consider making minor changes to your souroundings so that they better express and reflect who you are. All of these activities should be understood as means of improving the presentation of your inner self and your real values. They are not ends in themselves. Bi reminds you that as you focus on self-presentation, you should not take yourself too seriously. Do not allow yourself to become conceited or self-indulgent, and do not waste time on trivial things. The outer persona must serve the inner person, and not the other way around. The best way to achienve inner beauty is to let the beauty within shine forth in your words and deeds. If inner beauty is lacking, outward display will not compensate for it in the long run, for without the nourishment of what is within, outer beauty will soon fade. Therefore, the best long-term strategy for maintainance of grace and beauty is the development of a graceful and beautiful soul. Thus any focus on adornment must inevitably lead back to the care and cultivation of the soul. Charm and attractivness are genuine assets in life. gracefulness and poise are talents that can be mastered and fostered with good effect. BBut your first priority must always be self-development. If you pay too much attention to how you appear to other people, your life will become meaningless and superficial. A beautiful face does not compensate for selfishness and shallowness, beautiful possesions cannot compensate for lack of healthy human relationships, beautiful form does not excuse ugly behavior. If the Book of Changes has a preffered aestethic, it is one of simplicity and sincerity that naturally expresses healtiness and soundness of one's character. You should not expect that public dress and deportment can remedy a private lack, or that external possesions can substitute for internal self-possesion. Outer worth flows from inner worth and cannot replace it. No amount of fancy clothes or material goods will give you peace, emotional balance, and self-esteem. If you want others to value you, you must first value yourself as you are.
The image: fire at the foot of the mountains, this is the image of adornment, thus the superior person regulates the masses through enlightment, but he does not dare decide legal controversies and enforce criminal punishments

IChingClasses.Bo - Splitting Apart
-----------------
Above: IChingClasses.Gen , mountain Below: kun, earth
Number: 23
Keywords: Deterioration, Stripping away, collapse, falling apart
The judgement: Splitting apart. It is not beneficial to have somewhere to go.
The judgement description: Things are falling apart. The situation around you is deteriorating. Inferior people are on the rise and they are displacing people of value and merit. Relationships that once could be taken for granted have frayed and dissolved. Old ways of doing things are disintegrating and nothing has yet taken their place. Because the time is not propitous, there is no advantage in trying to undertake anything now. The deterioration that you face may result from changes in outer condition over which you have no control. In that case, you should not blame yourself for the fact that everything changes. Alternatively, the problem may be that elements of your life now seem to have outlived their usefulness. Old habits no longer serve your interests. Old assumptions no longer make sense. Things that you once took for granted no longer seem solid and dependable. This means you too are undergoing change. You are experiencing the end of an old cycle without the comforting assurance of what is yet to come. In either case, it is useless to struggle against the time. Your position has been weakened by the changes around you. You are vulnerable, either due to your position, your emotions, or both. For this reason avoid confrontation. You will only make things worse. The structure of the hexagram IChingClasses.Bo suggests that the proper course of conduct at this time. The lower trigram, IChingClasses.Kun, symbolizes devotion and acceptance. The upper trigram, IChingClasses.Gen, symbolizes stillness and patience. These are the virtues to adopt now. You must endure this period of deterioration and wait for better times to emerge. According to the law of change, they inevitably will. In the meantime, acquiesce the new condition without surrendering your principles. Keep quiet and maintain a low profile. Try to remain detached and untroubled to the extent that circumstances allow. Emotional reactions will only drain you and cause you to do foolish things. But if you can stay calm, collected, and above the fray, you can safeguard your position during this difficult time and you will be less vulnerable to manipulation. Change is coming both to your outer and to your inner experience. This change may be painful and upsetting. But you must let it run it's course. It is a law of nature. Whatever becomes great will eventually be lessened, and whatever becomes full will eventually be emptied. You cannot alter this general trend. Therefor, the wiseest course is to withraw and wait for time of renewal.

Keywords: Turning back, Repetance, Reform, Restoration, Rejuveration, The turning point
The judgement: Return. Success. Going out and coming in without harm. Friends come. No blame. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go.
The judgement description: IChingClasses.Fu represents the beginning for a new cycle of growth. The text offers the metaphor of seven days as the length that a cycle must take before it renews itself. If one begin with IChingClasses.Qian, and, starting from bottom to top, pleaces each like with its opposite, in six transformations the yin lines will have fully displaced the yang lines, and IChingClasses.Qian will become IChingClasses.Kun. The seventh transformation then begins a new sequence, with a yang line moving up from the bottom. You have reached a turning point, and the beginning of a new cycle. The law of change is in operation, and after a period of decline, confusion, and stagnation, there are new possibilities for renewal, clarity, and improvment. The old order is passing away and a new one is dawning. As things begin to change imperceptibly in your favor, new alliances and relationships can form, and old ones that had grown stale and frayed can become renewed and strengthened, the the text says 'friends come'. Nevertheless, you should not expect that everything will get better overnight. Rather, this hexagram describes the moment at which the tide begins to shift in your favor/ The days start to become longer at the winter solstice, but spring is still many months off. For this reason it would not be wise to try to force matters. Things are still in their earliest stages, and it would be the best to let them develop naturally, in their own time. Your position is not yet strong enough to take aggressive action, and in any case you cannot make everything better all at once. Instead, you should conserve your energies, secure in the faith that things are bound to improve if you give them time. What is most important is that you make a sincere and honest commitment to take the first steps in what will be a long and steady process of improvment. The hexagram IChingClasses.Fu represents an opportunity handed to you to begin again. If you have made mistakes in the past, or have strayed from the proper path, you must take this opportunity to correct yourself, repend , and ask forgiveness as necessary. Hence the text speaks of 'turning around and returning to the Way'. The Book of Changes is both optimistic and pragmatic about the possibilties of self-renewal. Every period of darkness is followed by new light. The Book of Changes is both optimistic and pragmatic about the possibilities of self-renewal. Every period of darkness is followed by new light. The Book of Changes thus holds out the hope that redemption is still possible if you devote yourself to it wholeheartedly. But you must act at the proper time. That is why the text says 'it is beneficial to have somewhere to go'. The possibilties for return and renewal are not endless. If you lack resolve and commitment, if you wait too long to change your ways, the path of redemption will be closed and you will have to wait through a new cycle. Fortunately, you are now in a propitious time when change is possible. A door has been opened for you. It is up to you to pass through it. Nothing can be forced. Everything must unfold in its natural time. But even if you cannot change everything imediately, before you begin your journey, you must first turn yourself around so that you can move in the right direction.
The image: thunder within the earth, this is the image of return, thus the ancient kings closed the borders at the time of solstice, merchants and travelers did not move about, and prices did not go forth to inspect the provices

Wu Wang - Innocence
-----------------
Above:  Heaven, Below: thunder
Number:  25
Keywords: Without expectations, without guile, acting naturally, being spontaneous, the unexpected
The judgement: Innocence. Supreme success. It is beneficial to persevere. If one is not what he should be, he meets with calamity, and it is not beneficial for him to undertake anything
The judgement description: In the Book of Changes, innocence does not carry the Christian connotation of being without sin. Rather to be innocent means to be genuine, sincere, and unaffected, without guile or deceit. For similar reasons, innocence does not mean being naive or unaware of one's souroundings. A wild animal acts naturally and instinctively, but senses are often finely attuned to its environment. To act innocently means to act spontaneously and naturally, without ulterior motives. However, human innocence means more than this, because aggressive, selfish, and depraved behavior can also be spontaneous. Innocence has a necessary moral dimension. It means doing the right thing for its own sake without thought or reward. An innocent person is naturally drawn to what is good and right and moves in this direction instinctively and without ceremony or calculation, without manipulation or deception. The text days that the innocent behavior that lacks moral qualities will only bring unhappiness and misfortune. Innocent action is the best way to deal with the unexpected events that life inevitably hands us. You cannot always prepare for every contingency and you cannot run your life according to a script, no matter how intricate and well thought out. You must be willing to improvise and respond naturally to the sittuation. This hexagram suggests that the best path for you to follow now is one of simplicity, honesty and naturalness. Try to do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. Your reward will come in due course. Don't overthink things and stop trying to turn every situation to your personal advantage. Getting lost in intricate machinations and devious plottings will only cause anexiety and confusion. Above all, don't try to manipulate people or take advantage of them. Your scheming will backfire. A sincere and uncomplicated approach has much greater chance of success. Act simply and spontaneously and you need not worry about the result. You will do the right thing in exactly the right way. Innocence means accepting your own nature and allowing the best parts of yourself to emerge naturally and spontaneously. You don't need to be something that you are not and you shouldn't try. Stop comparing yourself to other people, and don't worry whether you are sufficiently popular or influential. That way of thinking is simply a recipe for unhappiness. Be content to be yourself. Let your inner qualities shine through in your dealings with others, and they will respond. Conformity is a great pressure in social life. But there is no need to conform just for conformity's sake. Don't be tempted to do something that is beneath you just to fit in. Refuse to be drawn into anything deceptive or base. Instead, trust your instincts. You have the resources within you to judge the situation. Let your heart be your guide.
The image: Thunder rolling under heaven: All things behave with natural innocence. Thus the ancient kings rich in virtue and in harmony with the seasons nourished the ten thousand things

and to the achivment of something beyond your narrow self-interest, and you will have both the power and the vision to achieve great things, symbolized by crossing the great river.

These include not only your financial resources but also your social resources - your friends, relationships, and connections.

Keep on top of things and don't slack off. Be industrious. Challenge yourself. If you make the effort, you can do more than you ever thought yourself capable of. Giving your best each and every day will bolster your confidence and make you feel better about yourself. Developing and stretching yourself will contribute to your overall happiness and well-being as well as making it easier for you to succeed. Fourth, work for something larger than yourself. Dont confuse determination with isolation from others . This is a time for new possibilities, new sittuations, and even new relationships. Let go of your fears and inhibitions. It is time to go out into the world and make a difference. Dedicating yourself to others will redound to your benefit in the long run.

IChingClasses.Yi - Nurishment
---------------
Above: IChingClasses.Gen * mountain, below IChingClasses.Zhen thunder
Number: 27
Keywords: Jaws, Bluging cheeks, nourishing others, being nourished,
The Judgement: Nourishment, perseverance brings good fortune, observe carefully, how a person provides nourishment to others, and what he seeks to fill his own mouth with
The judgement description: This hexageam has a double theme: the nourishment of the self and the nourishment of others. Both are important to a happy life. Nourishment of self means care and cultivation of the self. The Book of Changes is concerned with much more than the nutrition that comes from eating good food. Nourishment means proper care of the different aspects of the self, including the body, the mind and the spirit. Just as the health of your body is affected by the quality of the food that you take in your mounth, the health of your life is determined by the quality of the activities that you engage in and the ways that you take care of yourself. Thus the lesson of IChingClasses.Yi is that you truly are what you eat when it comes to bodily nutrition and to forms of intellectual and spiritual nourishment. If you nourish yourslef in the right way, you will be healthier, happier, and better able to deal with the blows and misfortues of life when they inevitably occur. If you do not attend to your mental psysical and spiritual health, you will weaken and debilitate yourself. We might make an analogy to junk food, junk food fills you up in the short time but makes you unhealthy in the long run. There is also spiritual junk food. It is attractive and seductive but utimately leaves you feeling empty and craving more. It is up to you to decide what nourishment will you take into your body, what ideas you will take into your mind, and what people you will take into company. If you neglect exercise and sound diet, you will ruin your body. If you allow negative emotions in and focus your thoughts on what is unimportant or unworthy of you, those thoughts and emotions will frustrate and distract you. If you associate with people who use you and mistreat you, you will harm yourself in the long run. Thus , if you find that you lack peace, it may be because you have brought the causes of disturbance within yourself. A plant that is regurarly watered and attended to grows and flourishes. In the same way, whatever you nourish and attend to will grow and become more important in life. If you nourish the best parts of yourself, you will become a better, happier, and more well adjusted person. You eill be better able to handle whatever life throws at you. And you will help realize the full potetial of what your life can be. But if you attend to and nourish what is inferior in yourself, those aspects of your life will eventually come to dominate and you will suffer the consequences. Pander to the worst parts of your character and appentites and you will debase and devalue yourself and make yourself needlessly unhappy. You will waste your life's potential on what is meaningless and trivial. And you will weaken your body, mind and spirit so that life can more easily overwhelm you and defeat you. The care of your body and your soul is a question of self-respect. A person who has proper respect for himself takes care of himself, a person who does not respect himself harms himself. The Book of Changes does not insist that human beings are either essentially good or essentially bad. Rather, like evereything else in the universe, human beings have inherent tendencies and potentials for change. You can realize the best part of your potential thought wise activity and cultivation, you will foster the worst part by taking a contrary path. For this reason one can tell the quality of people by what they cultivate and what they fail to cultivate, what elements of their character they nourish and what they leave untouched, what they lavish their attention on and what they neglect. It is not enough to nourish yourself. You must also nourish and care for others. One can judge the quality of people not only by how they take care of themselves but also how they take care of others and on whom they bestow their concern. This hexagram suggests that you should think carefully about who you nourish and who you have failed to nourish properly. To nourish others is a way of nourishing the best parts of yourself. Just as you should excercise judgement in nourishing yourself, you should exercise judgement in nourishing others. Do not waste your time on people who abuse you or manipulate you. There is no point casting your pearls before swine. You should take care of those who cannot take care of themselves, for that is the mark of a superior and generous person. But you should not lavish your attention on those who can but who will not properly take care of themselves. If people do not learn to nourish themselves but repeatedly rely on your to help them out of their problems, you are offering them the wrong sort of nourishment. You must help them learn to help themselves.
The image: At the foot of the mountain, thunder. This is the nourishment. And thus the superior person is careful in his choice of words, and temperate in his eating and drinking.

Number: 28
Keywords: Too much, overload, ctritical mass, taking a stand, setting priorities, making choices.
The judgement: Greatness in Excess. The ridgepole sags. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go. Success
The judgement description: The ridgepole is a support beam on which the weight of the entire roof rests. The load that it bears is too great, therefore, it sags to the breaking point. The ridgepole is a metaphor for a situation which stresses and straings have reached their maximum. Something will have to give. Da Guo describes an exceptional time. Circumstances have reached a point of crisis. You face great pressures from all directions. Perhaps you have taken on too much, or perhaps obligations and expectations that were at one point bearable and reasonable have slowly but surely increased to the point that they have become too great. Whatever the case, something needs to be done, and quickly. You must make a transition to a new situation without delay. Nevertheless, you cannot force matters. A sudden movement of ridgepole under great stress will snap it, bringing the whoe roof crashing down. In the same way, the stresses and strains of the situation cannot be relieved by rash action. Instead, you must carefully consider the underlying causes of the crisis that you now find yourself in. There is "too much" in the situation, but you need to figure out what to much is. Perhaps you have overestimated what you can do because you are too eager to get ahead, or because you lack the necessary skills and talents. You have not learned the value of patience and proper preparation. Perhaps you have become too aggressive or to obsessive, on the one hand, or too anxious and apprehenisive on the other. Your fears and obsessions have cut you off from others, or have led you to engage in self-destructive habbits. Perhaps the pressure comes from your relationships with others. You or another person may be engaged in obsessive or excessive behavior. Your judgement- or theirs - is impaired because emotions and insecurtities are running high. Whatever the problem, you must act now to restore the balance in your life. It is up to you to restore a sense of reality and stability to the situation. Things cannot go on as they have been. You must reasses your priorities. You must make a change. Once you have decided what the problem is, you must act quickly but with gentleness and composure. The time calls for extraordinary measures, but the transition to the new sittuation must be peaceful and nonvoilent. The problem has been a growing imbalance. The solution will only come from restoriing balance, not from excerbating the problem. A time of greatness in excess calls for a corresponding greatness in your character. Not only must you recognize the need for change, but you must carry it out gently and swiftly, without fear or anexiety.
The image: The lake rises over the trees, this is the image of greatness in excess. Thus the superior person, when he stands alone, in unafraid, and if he has to renounce the world, he is undaunted.

Xian: Mutual Influence
---------------------
Above: Lake, below: Mountain
Number 31
Keywords: Influence, reciprocity, mutual attraction, courtship, wooing
The judgement: mutual influence. Success. It is beneficial to persevere. To marry a woman brings good fortune.
The judgement description: The theme of Xian is attraction, influence, and the formation of relationships. The relationship in question may be a love affair, but it could also be a friendship, family relations, a professional relationship, a business connection, or a political alliance. Relationships need time to grow, so that the parties can gradually gain trust and a degree of comfort with each other. This is symbolized by the union of IChingClasses.Dui (Joy, Acceptance) with IChingClasses.Gen(Patience, keeping still. Agrressivness and impatience may damage the relationship in its initial stages. Do not try to force matters or achieve everything overnight. Mutual attraction has its own ways that are not fully under the control of either party. It must develop naturally, on it's own terms. The theme of Xian is not simply influence but mutual influence. In forming relationships, do not try to manipulate or dominate, or force the other person to your own way of thinking. Influence must always be reciprocal, a matter of give and take. Only in this way can it be happy and long-lasting. There is an important difference between courtship and seduction. Seduction is the result of momentary enthusiasm; it is a desire to manipulate and control in order to fill up the emptiness that lies within the heart of the seducer. That emptiness, however, can never be filled, and therefore it leads to ever new desires, ever new attempts to conquest and control, ever new struggles to force the production of love in another's heart. Because it is not founded on mutual trust and respect, it will inevitably end in betrayl asnd unhappiness. If you desire to form a relationship with another, ask yourself whether you and the other person are engaged in courtship or seduction. Hence the text says it is beneficial to persevere, for perseverance marks the difference between short-term seduction and long-term commitment. Courtship should not be pursued for its own sake, but for the commitment it produces. Influence should not pursued for its own sake, but for the good things that it helps being into being. Through mutual attraction, people with complementary takents and affinities are brought together and create something great and lasting. Hence the text says "to marry a woman brings good fortune". Just as one should not seek love merely in order to seduce but in order to produce relationships that last, one should not seek to be influential simply to become famous and powerful but in order to achieve something of purpose and value. Finally, Xian teaches that the nature of a thing can be determined by what it attracts and what it is attracted to. What kind of company do you keepo and what kind of people do you pursue? If your relationships are unhappy, perhaps it is because you are attracting or pursuing the wrong sort of people, or perhaps it is because of some unhealthy vision you have about yourself. Good relationships are bringing out in you and in the people you are connected to.
The Image: A lake on the mountain, this is the image of Mutual Influence. The superior person receives others because he is open to them.

Above IChingClasses.Zhen - Thunder, Below: IChingClasses.Xun - Wind
Number : 32
Keywords:  Constancy, Long-lasting, Perseverence, Endurance, Duration
The judgement: Enduring. Success. No blame. It is beneficial to persevere. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go.
The judgement description: To endure means to keep going despite obstacles. Endurance is neither stagnatiopn or a state of rest. It progresses forward, unlike stagnation, and it keeps moving and growing, unlike rest. What endures renews itself and its effects through continous activity. What endures does so through change, not in spite of change. Its effects are understood against the experience of change. We see this in the cycle of the seasons that continually renew themselves as the earth moves around the sun. The cycle of the seasons repeats perpetually because its underlying causes continue. Plants and animals grow and change as they endure over time, When they cease to grow, they die, and they cease to endure. So is in life. All life is change. But in order to make change intelligible, there must be things that persist, against which change can be understood. To give your life meaninig, you must have something that endures: your identity, your relationships with others, and your principles. If you surrender what is enduring within you, then you surrender to the flux of events and become indistinguishable from them. Then there is nothing left of you. The lesson of IChingClasses.Heng is that you must learn to be consistent and persevere in the face ofg a changing world. Circumstances around you are changing, but you must maintain your integrity. Be consistent. Do not allow yourself to be blown about by a momentary alteration in fortunes. Do not let concerns about what others might think or how well others are doing by comparison lead you take drastic or reckless action. Instead, focus on what is and should be enduring in your life: your relationships, your character, and your principles. The situation that you face now requires you to persevere even though you face adversity and obstacles. Choose a path and stick to it. Keep your long term goals firmly in mind and progress slowly but surely toward them. Employ routines, practices, and cycles of activity that you can engage in over the long haul that will bring you closer and closer to your goal. Be content to make progress step by step through time-tested methods. Attend to the little things. If you neglect them, they will cause problems in the long run. But if you take care of everyday tasks, you will head off problems before they become large. The secret to endurance is character. Stick to your principles. Maintain your vision. This will see you through difficult times. You will inevitably have to adjust your strategy as events change, but do not give up its essential features. Don't be tempted to make radical alterations out of fear or anexiety. Slow and steady will win this particualar race. When things go well, keep going and do not become lazy. When things go badly, keep going and do not become disheartened or affraid. But wether things go well or badly, you must keep going. Never give up. Through endurance and continous practice, advantages will slowly but surely accumulate, and the situation will eventually move toward your desired goal.
The image: Thunder and wind. This is the image of what is Enduring. Thus the superior person stands firm, and does not change his direction.

Number: 33
Keywords: The piglet, Strategic withrawl, live to fight another day
The judgement: Retreat. Success. In small things, it is beneficial to persevere
The judgement description: You face hostile conditions and therefore should make a strategic retreat. This is entirely appropriate under the circumstances and should not be confused with cowardice or resignation. You should withraw when you are in the strongest position to do so, preserving your resources in order to fight another day. An army that retreats often after it is defeated in battle has waited too long. As a result, it often suffers heavy casualisties and it flees and must leave its arms and provisions on the field. In this case, by timing your withrawal appropriately, you avoid losses and conserve your power. In this way, you can actually strenghen yourself and begin preparations for effective countermeasures. Indeed, by retreating in the right way, you can actually make things more difficult for your opponent by limiting his options and means of attack. You can retreat to a position of strength with full power and resources to your disposal. By making yourself less vulnerable to your adversary, you make your adversary less powerful and less able to harm you. Applied outside of battlefield, the lesson of DUn is that properly timed retreat from a situation that is not serving your bes interests can be constructive and liberating. It can enhance your power rather than detracting from it. By withrawing from the sittuation you can free yourself from entanglements that sap your energies and form negative personalities who drag you down. This gives you the chance to take a broader view and rethink your priorities. Knowing when and how to retreat properly requires shrewdness, careful planning, and completele cooldeadedness. Good timing is essential. But when you exit is properly prepared and performed, the results are entirely favorable. Hence the text predicts success. Similar considerations apply if your question concerns your own lifestyle. You need to reasses the choices you have made and the habits that you have falled into. If your behavior is not making you happy and fulfilled, there is something wrong. Perhaps you are acting in a way that is contrary to your best interests. The adversity you face may lie  within yourself and your own self-destructive tendencies. If so, it may be time to withraw and start over. Move away from what is harmful and take the time to replenish yourslef.
The image: Mountain under heaven. This is the image of Retreat. Thus the superior person keeps petty people at a distance. not with anger but with reserve.

Number : 34
Keywords: The power of the great, Dominance, Great Strenght, Using your power wisely, uniting strenght with justice
The judgement: Great Power, It is beneficial to persevere
The judgement description: You have enormous power and influence on the situation now. But the secret to great power is knowing when and how to use it. And the moral responsibility of great power is to use it only for good purposes and not simply to attain selfish ends. The situation has great potential. You can achieve a great deal now. But do not become reckless or overconfident. Perhaps you think you hold all the cards, or that you can bully your way forward to get what you want. But if you become aggressive and try to impose your will on others, you will simply create resistence and opposition. You should carefully consider how other people will be affectred by your actions and what would be in the best interests of everyone before you go ahead. Exercise caution and circumspection. The proper use of great power is a matter of timing. Patience and care amplify your strength and influence, recklessness and carelessness dissipate them. Wait for the right moment to act. If you rush ahead and try to force matters, you may well make everything worse. Even if you do prevail ultimately. acting aggressively at the wrong time may make your ultimate victory much more difficult to achieve or much less happy and fulfilling when it arrives. Great power is truly great when it is vast or mighty but when it is used in the pursuit of something good and just. Great power that is excercises selfishly degenerates into tyranny, great power exercises thoughtlessly degenerates into chaos. If you find yourself in a position of strenght and influence, let your conscience be your guide. Don't allow yourself to be moved by greed, self-indulgence, or vanity. Do not act on impulse, and do not lord your power over others. Rather, simply decide what is right and do it without arrogance and without letting yourself be distracted by irrelevant or petty considerations. Unite strength with justsice, influence with integrity, and power with principle, and you will achieve something that is truly great.
The image:  Thunder in heaven above, this is the image of Great Power, thus the superior person does not act in any way contrary to codes of proper courtesy and decorum

Number 35
Keywords: Advance, Recognition, Proceeding forward
The judgement: Progress. The Marquis of Kang, Is honored with horses in great numbers, In a single day he is granted audience three times
The judgement description: The time is proputious. You can now make smooth and rapid progress toward your goals. The text compares the sittuation to a powerful feudal lord who is granted an aducience by his kind and rewarded for his service to the country. The feudal lord does not act independently of the king. Rather his progress results from serving the king and becoming part of something greater than himself. In like fashion the feudal lord rallies others around him, and they willingly cooperate because he does not act merely to further his own ambitions but to serve a higher cause. The king is not jealous of the lords power and success, he recognizes his servant's contributions and showers him with praise and rewards. The relationship between the two is symbolized by the two constituent triagrams: the lord is like earth - reliable, modest, and dependable, supporting the king with his strength. The sovereign is like fire - clear-headed and enlightened, understanding how his power ultimately depends on others. Out of such a relationship progress naturally flows. The hexagram Jin teaches that progress comes from cooperation and mutual recognition. Those who work for others help them achieve important goals, those in charge recognize the contribution of the other people who serve them, reward them appropriately, and show appreciation for their efforts. Jealousy and self-centeredness destroy progress. Respecting the dignity of others and rallying around a common cause produce progress. It is important not to confuse selfishness which hinders progress with ambition, which furthers it. The feudal lord is amibitious, but there is nothing wrong with ambition when it is combined with loyalty and uprightness. Ambition leads to progress when it serves a higher cause. Because you have devoted yourself to something larger than your own self-interest, you can now make easy, sustained progress. People will recogniize your abilities and acknowledge your contributions. Like the sun risigtn over the earth, it is your time to shine. But don't let success go to your head, remember not to become self-centered and narrow-minded. Cooperate with people and help them achieve their goals. Be generous. The more valuable you make yourself to others, the more influence and esteem you will have. Share your insights. You have good ideas, don't hide your light under a bushel. This is a time of uncommon clarity. If you are willing to communicate what you know , and work for the common good, you can have a beneficial influence on the sittuation. In turn, this will cause people to have increased confidence in you. They will supoprt you and help you achieve your goals.

The judgement: Darkening of the Light, In adversity, it is beneficial to persevere.
The judgement description: You face unfavorable circumstances. You encounter criticism and opposition, you projects fail to prosper, or those who have control over your life lack confidence in you. Whatever the problem, there is little that you can do about it for the time being. You must wait out the bad times until things take a turn for the better. Because you are currently trapped in a hostile environment, the best strategy right now is to keep a low profile. You must hide your light. If you try to assert yourself, the people who surround you will not be sympathetic and will rebuff you. If you object to your treatment, people will not understand, and you may make things even worse for yourself. Instead of protesting, it is better to allow those in your environment to believe that you accept the situation. Someone may be jealous of you or resent you. You should not give them an opportunity to harm you. Do not be aggressive and do not call attention to yourself. This is no time to pick a fight. Conditions are not in your favor right now, and you do not have the resources to prevail. Nevertheless, during this difficult time you must continue to have faith in yourself. Do not give up just because things are not going well. As the text says, in times of adversity, it is beneficial to remain steadfast and to persevere. It is a test of your will and your endurance. You must preserve your inner light - the still, small voice within. Do not let the darkness on the outside extinguish the light on the inside, for then there will be nothing left of you when times improve. People and events will surely provoke you. But you must maintain your composure and your emotional compass. Do not let what others say and do cause you to lose heart. You cannot let their ignorace or their bad judgement undermine your self-confidence. They see only a small part of the picture. Their values are not your values. And even though things seem rough right now, time has a way of turning present disadvantages into seeds of later advantages. You will not be down forever. Hostile circumstances require you to accept the situation for the time being. You must allow people to think that you acquiesce and are going along. But you must never surrender. Maintain your resistance on the inside. Hold fast to your enduring values and to your ultimate goals. Remember who you are and what you stand for. Even though there is little that you can do at present, you must preserve your integrity during these dark times. Keep your heart and soul steadfast and ever fixed on what is most important. Eventually, things will change for the better, and you will prevail.
The image: The light has descended into the center of the earth, this is the image of darkening of light, thus the superior person oversees the masses. He hides his light, yet it still shines.

Number: 37
Keywords: The household, the family, the clan, close-knit groups, house people, playing your part, establishing expectations, serving as an example, creating mutuality and trust
The judgement: The family. The perserverance of a woman is beneficial
The judgement description: Although the hexatgram Jia Ren concerns the family, in ancient China the family was a metaphor and model for virtually all other forms of social organziation. Hence the hexagram is also about the ideal forms of social life and social relations. Each member of the family - father, mother, son, daughter, elder sibling, younger sibling - had specific duties and relationships, When each of them fulfilled their proper obligations to the others, each of them played their respective role (as father, mother, son, daughter, etc.) appropriately, and the family was well ordered. The Chineese belived that if the family was well ordered, then all of society would be well ordered.
In ancient Chinese society, men were expected to the heads of households, women were expected to be subordinate to them. The relationship between superior and subordinate was analogized to that between a man and a woman in a family. Hence a suborditate is always yin to the superior's yang. Because in China, everyone was subordinate to someone else, everyone - including all men - were yin to somebody else's yang. Thus when the text says "preserverance of a woman is beneficial" it refers to the steadfast uprightness of a person who is in a yin (subordinate) position. In today's more egalitarian society, we cannot accept the Book of Changes assumptions about the repsective roles of sexes, or its acceptance of natural hierarchies among people based on the model of the family. Nevertheless, the more general advice that the book of changes offers is still valid. It applies to any social relationship, and especially to close-knit organizations. If you want the relationship or the organization to run smoothly, you must be committed to it. Play your appropriate and assigned role and work for the greater good of everyone involved. If everyone in the organization does this, it will be well ordered and peace will reign. Duties and responsabilties should be laid out clearly in advance so that everyone knows their role and feels that they will be valued for their contribution. whether they are a leader, a follower, a specialist, or one among equals. The group should be well ordered so that people know what they can expect from others and know what is expected of them. They must be able to take pride in their contribution to the greater good and they must be honored and recognized for what they do. Tehn they will not feel abused or put upon and social bonds will be strenthend over time. It is not enough to assign people roles and expect them to fill them. Trust, consideration, and mutual affection are necessary for relationships to thirive and prosper. Mechanically, enforcing otder misses the informal elements of mutuality, reciprocity, and affection that are necessary to any successful long-term alliance. If the relationship is too rigid, it will not stand the stresses that everyday life puts on it, much less the strains caused by a genuine crisis. Mutuality and benevolence bind the group together and give it the flexibility to improvise and change to meet changing times. If you have not been paying enough attention to your relationships, now is a good time to mend fences, renew lines of communication, and show people that you care about and repsect them. Remember that the social cement of courtesy and reciprocity binds close-knit groups together. All too often we treat people we live with every day with less respect and give them less attention than we do perfect strangers or mere aquaintances that we are trying to impress. Intimacy should not mean taking people for granted. Rather, it should mean valuing those close to you especially. Showing a little consideration every now and then will help keep the relationship together through adversity. If the problem is lack of discipline, you should immediately take steps to restore order. It may be necessary to get tough for a while until appropriate expectations are reestablished. But the point of discipline is not to weild power or to inflict punishment for its own sake. It is to let everyone know where they stand and show them how others rely on them. Good discipline and clear expectations within the family can actually support the mutual trust and affection of its members, just as trust and effection can help keep relationships well ordered and running smoothly.
The Image: Wind emerges from the fire, this is the image of family, thus the superior person ensures that his words have substance and his deeds constancy.

Number: 38
Keywords: Estrangement, misunderstanding, different points of view, polarity, diversity, creative tension, finding commonality within difference
The judgement: Opposition, In small matters there is good fortune
The judgement description: Opposition and estrangement have entered the situation. Misunderstandings have arisen, and so people mistrust and doubt each other. For this reason, they are not cooperating and cannot make any progress. In these circumstances it is important to proceed slowly and carefully. Mistrust has to be dissipated gradually, in small steps. Hence the text says that good fortune comes from small things. Even in marked opposition there is usually some kind of commonality. In order to relax the tensions, it  is best to remind people of what they have in commmon and turn their attention to values that all share. If you find yourself estranged from other people, try to see things from their point of view. Consider that they are probably as mistrustful of you are you are of them. Viewing other people not as enemies but as fellow human beings trying to make their way in the world is the first step to resolving conflict. Be tolerant and gracious. Be willing to make the first move in order to meet other people halfway. Doing this will begin to dissipate the atmosphere of confrontation and mutual suspicion. By altering the tone of your interactions and making signs that you seek understanding and reconciliation, you can begin breaking down barriers of mistrust and soften attitudes that have hardened over time. But it is important to proceed with great sensitivity and caution. Do not think that you can make everything better overnight. Trust takes time to be reestablished, especially when opposition has been severe or longstanding. Do not rush things. Give people, including yourself, time to move closer together and find a method of reconciliation. In a time of opposition, making the first move takes courage. Don't allow your pride or your fear of being thought weak keep you from reaching out to others and resolving misunderstandings. People cling to opposition not because they are strong, but because they are weak: the sittuation makes them feel insecure and they are afraid of what will happen if they expose themselves. As a result, they allow resentments to build and misunderstandings to fester. By contrast, people who know their own worth are the ones who can afford to be tolerant and generous. They understand that people can improve their lives if they are willing to risk a little emotional pain and uncertainty. They do not confuse tolerance with deficiency or magnanimity with weakness.

The Judgement: Obstruction. The southwest is beneficial. The northeast is not. It is beneficial to see a great person. Perseverance beings good fortune.
The judgement description: The southwest represnets reciptivity and patience, the northeast represents assertion and advance. Hence the text says that instead of pressing ahead urgently one should hold back and accept the situation for what it is. You are faced with obstacles that you cannot overcome. The more you struggle with your problems, the larger they seem to loom. It is time to take a break from your efforts and pause. Stop trying to enforce your will. Instead, look at the things with detachment, humility, and acceptance. Be willing to learn. The point of detaching yourself from your current struggles is not to give up hope of eventual success. Quite the contrary: you must be absolutely determined to prevail in the long run. Rather, the point is to restore your emotional balance and clear your head. Before you can regroup, you must free yourself from the emotional entaglements of past approaches that have been counterproductive. You need a fresh start and a fresh attitude. This is the meaning of the statement that the "southwest" is beneficial. In the Book of Changes, the southwest is the direction associated with the earth. By adopting the virtues associated with earth: acceptance, humility, devotion, and patience - you will regain your composure and recharge your batteries. The text says "it is beneficial to see a great person". After you have taken the time to reassess the situation, you need to join forces with others. Ask for advice from people you respect and trust, and who understand you and your goals. They may have fresh perspectives. Don't be too stubborn to admit that you need help or too proud to accept it from others. Work together with people to tackle the problem rather than trying to go it alone. Finally, do not give up hope. Persevere. Even though you may have to wait, or make a strategic retreat, if you maintain an eduring devotion to achieving your goal, you will eventually prevail. The test of great character is the ability to let go and walk away temporarily from a goal while being utterly devoted to achiving it in the long run. The obstructions that you face today will help develop your character so that you can better meet the challenges of the future. When obstruction leads to reassassment and self-improvment, it can even be a blessing in disguise.

The judgement description: Things have been frustrating for a long time. You have been unable to make progress, or your relationships have been full of conflict and misunderstanding. Now things start to get better. Tension begin to be eased. Difficulties begin to resolve themselves. It is as if a storm has broken and the air has suddenly cleared. You feel liberatated from what has been a seemingly endless cycle of failure and frustration. There is new hope. When conditions start to improve after a long period of stagnation, it is perfectly all right to celebrate and feel joy. A heavy burden has been lifted from your shuolders, it is no wonder that you feel simulated. But the most important thing is to regain your balance. Hence the text speaks of the "southwest" the direction traditionally associated with the earth. It is time to put yourself on solid ground and restore conditions of normalcy. Return to a healthy pattern of living and restore the natural rythms of your life. Now that the tensions have begun to be relieved, you don't need to make any bold or audacious gestures. Things are already moving in the right direction. Ask yourself whether there are any remaining matters that need to be taken care of to restore things to their regular and proper order. If there are, take care of them immediately. Do just what is necessary, promptly and unobstrusively, without making a fuss. Spend some time thinking about why things went wrong. Did something in your behavior and your attitudes hold you back? Did you unwittingly keep the cycle of frustation going though your thoughts and actions? When the moment of deliverance comes, you have the opportunity to make things right and to let go of the mistakes of the past. There is no better time for this than the present. As the text says, an early start brings good fortune.
The image: Thunder and rain invigorate, this is the image of Deliverance, thus the superior person forgives misdeeds and pardons mistakes.


IChingClasses.Sun - Decrease
-----------------
Above: gen, mountain Below: dui, lake
Number : 41
The judgement: Decrease with sincerity, brings supreme good fortune, no blame, one is able to persevere, it is beneficial to have somewhere to go
The judgement description: Decrease is not necessarily a bad thing. Increase and decrease are basic features of life. They are part of a natural cycle and succeed each other inevitably. Everything that expands too far will eventually contract. Everything that is made great will eventually be made small. A wise person tries to understand the nature of the time, in order to discern when decrease is appropriate. When things have proceeded too far, or when practices have become excessive, it is time for decrease. When aspects of your life have become too confusing or too complicated, it is time to step back and simplify. Decrease means understanding that you must give up some thing to get other things. In the long run, your happiness and success depend on learning to recognize what you must surrender as we aas what you wish to obtain. The task before you now is to put priorities in order. What is most important to you? What must be given up? Face facts. There is no shame in decrease if it is appropriate to the time, and it is appropriate to the time if it helps you clarify your values, achieve your goals. or get you though a difficult period in your life.
The same principle apply to your conduct and demeanor. Because you want to much too badly, you fill your life with complications and entanglements. Simplify. Get rid of excess and affectation. Return to the basic principles and straight forwardness in your dealings with others. Perhaps you ego has gotten a bit inflated or your expectations have gotten out of hand. Now is the time to put things in perspective and to decide what is most important to you. Hence the text says "It is beneficial to have somewhere to go". Scaling back and doing with less can strenghten your character. It will help you meet the challendges ahead. Do not be concerned if others have more than you do. Hence the text "two small bows" are sufficient to make the offering. This means that people who are devoted and down-to-earth will be accepted even if their worldly possesions are meager. What is in your heart is much more important than what is in your pockets. WHat matters is not what you have but who you are. Don't put on airs or pretend to be something that you are not. It is completely unnecessary and may even be counterproductive. Act with sincerity and integrity, and the quality of your character will shine through to others. Be generous and helpful. Do not insist on taking the lead. Instead, be content to play your part. Be willing to give what you have to help others. Have faith: If you are decreased in the short run, you will surely be increased in the long run. As the text says "decrease with sincerity brings about supreme good fortune".
The image: At the foot of the mountain, a lake, this is the image of decrease. Thus the superior person controls his anger and restrains his desire.


IChingClasses.Yi - Increase

Number: 42
Keywords: Benefit, Harvest, Enrichment, Generosity, Sharing your bounty
The judgement: Increase. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go. It is beneficial to cross the great river
The judgement description: You are in the midst of a very fortunate time, one that offers excellent opportunities to resolve old problems and start new projects. You can now make progress on things that seemed too difficult before. Obstacles fall away. Your relationships with other bloom and grow. Everything flourishes. There are two reasons why things are going so well. Their cooperation brings success. When those who are in more powerful and influential position act to benefit those with less status and influence, everyone benefits. WHen people feel that those in charge have their interests at heart, they willingly cooperate in even the most amibitious projects, and even the most difficult tasks can be completed successfully. Second, things are prospering because people pau attention to the fundamentals rather than to surface appearances. When a choice has to be made between making outward aspects of things more impressive or strengthening foundations, people choose the latter without hesitation, and they are right to do so. These good times will not last forever. Therefore, it is up to you to capitalize on them. First you must decide what your priorites are. The text says that if you want to benefit from the time, you have to have somewhere you want to go. If you dither and hesitate between various projects, or try to do too many things at once, you will squander your opportunities. Second, once you know what your goals are, you cannot hesitate, you need to take action. As the text says you must cross the great river. When the time is propitious, you can afford to take calculated risks and embark on challenging endeavors. It is a matter of faith and commitment. Have the courage of your convictions. Second, once you know what your goals are, you cannot hesitate, you need to take action. As the text says, you must cross the great river. When the time is propitious, you can afford to take calculated risks and embark on challenging endeavors. It is a matter of faith and commitment. Have the courage of your convictions. Third, to make the most of the good times, you must comrephend the causes that produced them. That means paying attention to fundamentals rather than trivial matters. Spend more time on the foundations of the work and less time on impressing people or fathering your own nest. Always remember that the work is more imporant than you are. Finally, you will succeed only if you do something that benefits people other than yourself. The secret to increase is reciprocity. If you work only for your own self-interest, or if you try to hog all the benefits for yourself, people will not join in, and you will not prosper. But if you are called to do something that serves a larger interest, and you are willing to share the benefits with others, people will rally around you. Pass on your bounty to others, especially to the people who work with you. Your generosity will be rewarded in countless ways. When you focus on what you can contribute to the world rather than what you can take away from it, you help keep the good times going.
The image: Wind and thunder, this is the image of increase, thus the superior person when sees the good, imitates it, when he has faults, corrects himself.

Guai - Resolution

Number: 43
Keywords: Resoluteness, Determination, Decisivness, Speaking forthrightly, Elimination, Eradicating remaining evils, Parting, Cutting off, Breakthrough
The judgement: Resolution. Declare it at the court of the king. Proclaim it sincerly and truthfully. There is danger. Notify the city. It is not beneficial to resort to arms. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go.
The judgement description: Something is wrong and you must rectify it. Inferior elements still dominate the situation and you must eliminate them. If you do nothing, you will compromise yourself and make a bad situation worse. The problem may be external - people or institutions that undermine the good and prevent progress. Or it may be internal - your own bad habits and negative emotions that weigh you down. Either way, the obstacles are real. You must face up to them and surmount them. You are not unaware of the problem. But you have esitated, telling yourself that the problem is not so bad or that it will eventually take care of itself. But the time for hesitation and temporizing is past. If you do not act, nothing will get better. You must be absolutetly convinced that change is necessary and you must be determined to play a part in that change. When a problem is great, it requires cooperation to overcomne it. If you attack the problem with insufficient resources, you will either be defeated or you will be forced to compromise. And you cannot compromise. The problem must be fully eliminated. Don't overreact and don't try to solve the problem by yourself overnight. You need help if you are to prevail. The best way to gather public support is to state forthrightly what the problem is. If something bad has occured, don't be affraid to say honestly and candidly. Be curteous and evenhanded in dealing with others. You do not want to arouse unnecessary offense or opposition, and you do not want people to think that your emotions have gotten the better of you. But you cannot dissemble or suggarcoat what is wrong. You must speak the truth. You cannot rally people together if they do not understand the seriousness of the sittuation. Evils and injustices can never be eradicated until they are named and identified as what they are. To eliminate evil, you must first expose it in order to gain public support. You must not use violent or underhanded methods to solve your problem. Force leads to more force, evil begets more evil. Do not get in the gutter with what you are trying to eliminate. If you allow yourself to get entangled in passion or hatered, you will become what you oppose. The same principle apply if you are trying to eliminate bad habits in yourself. Be honest with yourself, but don't engage in self-loathing or self-defeating behavior. If you are trying to reform a relationship, you and your partner must have the courage to sincere and candid with each other if you are to work through your problems. But you should not engage in backbiting, manipulation, and emotional assaults. That will only make the sittuation worse. You must discuss your problems openly and frankly, and try to recognize the causes of your present unhappiness. Strive to reach mutual understanding rather than mutual recrimination. Then put your previous struggles behind your and move on.
The image: Water from the lake rises up to the heavens, this is the image of resolution, thus the superior person dispenses his riches to those below, he abides in virtue by shunning evil.

Above: Quian - Heaven, Below: IChingClasses.Xun - Wind
Number : 44
Keywords: Temptation, Brief encounter, Coming to meet, Coupling of opposites, two ships that pass in the night, Hidden dangers, The beginnings of corruption, Nip problems in the bud
The judgement:  Encounter. The woman is powerful. Do not marry her.
The judgement description: The text analogizes temptation to a femme fatale who is young and seemingly harmless but who has powerful abilities to seduce others. She is represented by the single yin line, which seduces the five yang lines above it. Comparing temptation with a powerful woman seemed nartual to the patriarchal society of ancient China, yin was traditionally associated not only with the feminine but also with the small, the dark, the evil, and the inferior. But we need not maintain these ineglitarian views to understand the point. There is no reason whyh the seducer could not be male and victim female. In either case, the text advises not to marry the seducer. Marriage is a long-term commitment. In IChingClasses.Gou there is a relationship that cannot and should not last. If one commits oneself to the temptation or allows it to become a permanent part of one's life, misfortune will result. The flirtation seems harmless at first - delightful and inviting. However, it gains its power from the fact that ones to meet it and allows it to take over. Temptation advances on us because - whether we realize it or not - we meet it halfway. You find yourself in a situation that seems outwardly pleasant and agreeable. But there are hidden dangers lurking behind an attractive facade. Troubles are brewing, although you dont realize it. It is possible that someone has a hidden agenda. Or that people you are dealing with are simply not right for you. In any case, be exceedingly careful about offers and promises that people make to you. It is not yet clear whom to trust. Warch what people do and not what they say. Try to get additional information about their uprightness and trustworthiness. You don't want to put yourself in a compromising position. It is important not to let yourself be drawn into something that is beneath you or that you will later regret. Therefore, guard your independence and your integrity jealously. Don't allow others to manipulate you. Inferior people worm their way into your life only because you regard them as harmless and allow them entry. They get you to trust them and help them by making it appear that they need your help and your trust. They play on good tendencies of reciprocity and mutual sympathy to get their way. If you dont let yourself be duped in the first place, they will not gain influence over you. There is no need to ne haughty or aggressive. You shouldnt overreact to the situation. But you need to make your own position clear so that you are not pushed around or misused. If you signal that you care committed to the right path and unlikely to be deceived, people who do not have your best interest at heart will move on to another target. Only those who are sincere will remain. Temptation often seems small and harmless at first. But as soon as you induge it and make it part of your life, it can grow in unexpected ways and gain more and more power over you. If you embarked on something that is not worthy of you , turn back while it is still easy to avoid the situation and make amends. If you have started to develop bad habits, nip them in the bud before they have a chance to become fixed. If you have begun to  be obsessed with doubts, worries, or negative thoughts, try to counteract them before they become a major part of your emotional life. Everything  is easier to deal with when it is small. It is only when we neglect it that is has a chance to become large.

Cui - Gathering together

Number: 45
Keywords: Gathering, Massing, Joining others, assembling, having a common cause, holding yourself together, pitching in, cooperation between leaders and followers
The judgement: Gathering together. Success. The king approaches his temple. It is beneficial to see a great person. Success. It is beneficial to persevere. Brining a great offering means good fortune. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go.
The judgement description: Fostering unity takes skill and patience. In order to bring people together, whether in a community, a charitable organization, or a business, you must give them a shared sense of purpose. You must give up the group direction, hence the text says, It is beneficial to have somewhere to go. Common goals, shared symbols, and shared belifs unite individuals and let them feel that they are working for something more than selfish interests or petty concerns. It is the duty of leaders to instill this sense of higher purpose. The text speaks of the king entering his temple. In ancient times rulers would lead their people by making a sacrifice to their ancestors. This sacrifice reminded people that they had common origins and that toghether they were keeping faith with something noble and valuable. Calling upon common ancestors and invoking shared traditions was a powerful symbol of community, which constituted them as a single people with a common history and destiny. In the same way, if you are called to bring people togeher, you must instill in them a sense of shared history and purpose. You must give them something to belive in. You must bring "a great offering" : something that performs the same function as the offering to the ancestors that the ancient kings made. You must find symbols that people can rally around and that express their joint commitment. You must create or invoke a common narrative through which people can connect themselves back to the past and ahead to the future. Thus gathering together means much more than simply assembling individuals at a single place and time. It means gathering them together with those who have gone before and with those who will be part of the group in the future. in this way the group's members can see themselves as part of a continuing project or tradition. In othder to gather other people together, you must first gather yourself together. To do this you must be certain about your values and aims. If you are internally conflicted, you will be outwardly hesitant and you will not be able to inspire confidence. Clarity of moral vision is necessary to rally people together around a great cause. When that clarity is present, an association whose members are united around a common goal can do remarkable things. Groups function best when their members willingly cooperate. If people become selfish, the group will not succeed and may even fall apart. Conflict is inevitable in any large organization because people have different interests and different point of view. But this is acceptable as long as the disagreements concern how best to realize shared values and goals rather than attempts by one faction to suppress and dominate another. If you are a member of a group, be willing to work with the leaders and help them succeed. Understand your place in the larger organization and give your best. If you are a leader, make sure that you act in the interests of everyone. Remmember the Chineese proverb that to rule is to serve.

If you want to reach your goal, all you have to do is maintain this successful strategy. Have faith in yourself. Proceed step by step. When you encounter obstacles, don't be discouraged. Don't lose your temper or try to force things. Instead, be modest and unassuming. Adapt to the situation and keep going. Imagine a young plant that is moving through the soil toward the light. When it encounters earth, it adapts and shifts directions until it finds the best possible space to push upward, then  it simply continues its steady ascent. In t he same fashion, you will find that if you put your mind to it you can easily move around whatever stands in your way. Don't be afraid to ask people for help or advice. Because the time is right, they will be happy to give it to you. The important thing is to keep making steady progress. The text says that setting out toward the south brings good fortune, the the south represents activity. be confident that if you work hard you will eventually get what you want.

Like a plant inching ever upward, you will reach the surface and feel the warm sunlight shining on you.

Number 47
Keywords: Exhaustion, Being restricted, Hardship, Adversity, Inner affliction, Dried up, Impasee
The judgement: Opression. Success. With perseverance, the great person brings about good fortune. No blame. What one says is not believed.
The judgement description: It seems ad if the world is consipring against you. You are faced with adversity everywhere you turn. Inside, you feel exhausted, tired, burned out. Life seems to have lost all its spark and attraction. Yet the text says that times of oppression hold the promise of success. How can this be? The present situation is a test of your character. It takes a great soul to remain undaunted by adverse circumstances. Right now there is nothing you can do to make things better. You will simply have to wait out this very trying time. If you let your misfortunes get to you and crush your spirit, you will be utterly lost. But if you can maintain your equanimity and your patience, you will be able to endure, and you will become a stronger, better person in the process. If you do not allow them to defeat you, the difficulties you face will toughen your spirit and shape the conditions of your future success. That is why the text sayts that the great person brings about good fortune. People of truly sound and noble character bend in the face of adversity, but they are not broken. They emerge from the trial with renewed hope and the will to go forward and prevail. They succeed because they possess an inner strenth that has been tempred and tested by fate. For the time being, you will have little influence on the situation. The people who control your life do not listen to you and will not trust you. Anything you say to them will only fall on deaf ears. Because you cannot affect the outside world, you are thrown back on your own inner resources. Although you must bide your time, you must remain determined to succeed in spite of all obstacles. Now more than ever you must persevere, holding fast to your integrity and to your belief in yourself. When you have a world that you cannot control, your inner tranquility is the one thing that you have a say about. No one can take this away frfom you unless you allow it. To prevail against an inner oppression that consists of despair, self-abuse, and hopelessness. Emotions like these drain the life from you and rob you of the will to go on. To defeat them, you must maintain your faith, your emotional balance, and your self-confidence. If you can win this inner victory, no outside foe can stand against you.

IChingClasses.Jing - The well
------------------
Above: IChingClasses.Kan, water Below: IChingClasses.Xun , wind
Number: 48
Keywords: Human potential, human resources, replenishing, renewal, nourishing others, going deeply into things, human nature, the unchanging
The judgement: The well. One can change the town, but one cannot change the well. It neither increases or decreases. They come and go, drawing from the well. If the rope does not go all the way, or the jugs break, Misfortune
The judgement description: The theme of IChingClasses.Jing is the need to replenish yourself and others. A well that is properly tended is inexhaustable. When you draw water from it, there is still more water to draw on. But when you do not take care of the well, or the environment that surrounds it, the well becomes muddy or dries up. Then the well is of no use to anyone. To replenish other people you must support them and give them room to flourish. Accept people for what they are, do not try to force them into preconceived molds. Consider how you can be of help to others rather than how you can get everyone to do your bidding. If you create conditions of trust and reciprocity in the world around you, your relationships with others will be like an inexhaustible well that you and everyone else can draw on. But if you act selfishly and high-handedly, people will not cooperate with you or with each other and the resources that mutuality produces will dry up. The well is a model for how to life your life. Those who are like a well are dependable. They are unfailing in their abilities to nourish and benefit others. They are continually replenished by the cooperation that they receive and by the affection and esteem in which other people hold them. Because they create an atmosphere of trust and mutual support, they are inexhaustible. The more they give, the more they are enriched. If you have been neglecting your relationships, now is an excellent time to change things. Be generous and humane to other people and they will respond naturally. Similar considerations apply to the care and nourishment of yourself. Within you are the resources of your body, your mind and your spirit. If you take care of them properly, they are inexhaustible. but if you neglect them or abuse them, they will dry up. Your body needs proper nutrition and exercise. Your mind needs education and intellectual challenge. Your spirit needs something to belive in and to strive for. Replenishing yourself means using your skills and talents rather than letting them waste away. It means challenging and stretching yourself so that you can continue to grow. Don't fritter your life away on meaningless and trivial things. Dedicate yourself to soething you think is really valuable and pursue it. Focus on living up to your own potential rather than on whether you are sufficiently admired. Treat yourself with respect if you want others to respect you. A key methaphor of this hexagram is depth. The text says that the rope must fo down all the way into the well if you want to draw fresh water. If you want to achieve somethinig worthwhile, you must not stake over the surface of things but go deeply into them. If you want healthy, lasting relationships with others, you must make genuine commitments rather than engage in superficial interactions. To succeed at life, you must have depth in your character. You may think that you do not have much to offer. But do not sell yourself short. Be willing to dig deep down inside yourself and realize your potential. Make the effort and the results will surprise you. You do not yet know all the things that you are capable of. To go deeply into things you also need devotion. Replenish yourself and other takes time and attention. It is a continuous process. It requires commitment. If you are careless and neglect your talents and your relationships with others , you waste them and they will waste away. Then you are like the clumsy person who breaks the jug that the water is drawn from. The water is still there, but there is no way that you can get at it. Your ability to replensih yourself is connected to how well you replenish others. If you are stubborn and difficult, or if you shut yourself off from other people, your mind, body, and spirit will eventually suffer. You are like a well that no one tends and no one visits; it is no surprise that such a well becomes muddy from lack of use. But if you engage with the world and cooperate with others in a spirit of reciprocity and goodwill, you will find that all aspects of your life will magically improve. Then you become like a well with clear, cold water that nourishes others and is continually replenished.
The image: Water over wood. This is the image of the Well. Thus the superior person encourages the people at their work, and urges them to help one another.

Ge - Revolution

Number: 49,
Keywords: Molting, Shedding old skin, Metamorphosis, transformation, out with the old
The judgement: Revolution, On your own day, there is confidence, supreme success, it is beneficial to persevere, regrets vanish
The judgement description: Revolution means the abolition of an old order in preparation for a new one. Such drastic changes are appropriate only when there is no other alternative. If you are contemplating such a change, it is because you feel that things have gone as far as they can in their present form and something entirely new is called for. When you realize that the time has come for revolution in your life, it is usually because you have already begun to experience a revolution in your heart. You may find yourself questioning long-held assumptions and belifs. What once seemed so central and important to you now begins to seem irrelevant and beside the point. All of this means that your values and expectations are changing. You have begun to see things in different ways. It is dizzying and leaves you uncertain. But it is a necessary precondition to transform your life. The name of the hexagram Ge, compares this process to the shedding of an old skin in preparation for a new one. You should not be afraid of the changes that you want to make. Now more than ever you need to have courage and faith in yourself. But before you proceed, you must think things through carefully. Take the time to consider the ramifications of what you are about to do. Radical change that is well motivated and properly prepared invigorates your life. Change that is reckless and ill considered can be very destructive. Remember that you are not the only person who will be affected by the changes. You must take other people's feeling and interests into account. No one goes into a revolution alone, whether by choice or by circumstance one takes many others as well. You will need the support of others if you are to succeed in making a successful transformation. Discuss your change of heart with them and describe what you plan to accomplish. Talk openly about their fears and concerns as well as your own. If you show them that you are not being self-centered, capricious , and arbitrary but that this is what you really need to do, they will be more supportive than you expect. And they may offer helpful advice about how to achieve your goals. When you have thoroughly considered the need for change and garndered the support of others, you are ready to act. Good timing is curcial to a successful transformation. Do not be afraid to kmake far-reaching changes in your lifestyle, your habits or your environment. You must change your life in order to make it cohere with who you are now. As the text says, when your own day comes, there is confidence. The same principle apply to political revolutions or to transformations in large organizations. Drastic change is a very serious matter. It should not be undertaken lightly, but only when there is nothing else to be done. A successful revolution requires a leader who is called to the task. You should not attempt radical change unless you feel a calling to lead and serve others, an inner compulsion that convinces you that a change must come and that you must gain the support of others. If you do not do this, your attempts will fail. Perhaps most important, you must make the changes not merely for your own sake but for the good of those who follow you. Revolution is justified when it helps the people and not merely their leaders. And you have a duty to guide the movement forward to something creative and positive, and to prevent events from spinning out of control and becoming excessive of destructive. If you can do all these things, you should have no regrets about making the necessary changes.
The image: Fire in the lake: This is the image of Revolution, thus the superior person sets the calendar in order, to illuminate in accordance with the times

The judgement: The Caldron. Supreme good fortune. Success.
The judgement description: The Ding, or ritual caldron, formed part of a religious service in which sacrifices were made to a divinity. Through this ritual, people purified themselves and rededicated themselves to spiritual ends. The text urges you to model yourself after the Ding. It is time to purify your motives and devote yourself to worthy aims. The text promises success and supreme good fortune. But it is not necessarily worldly success.

Different ingredients were mixed in the ritual caldron and then cooked together to fom a divine offering.

Keywords: Gradual Advance, Slow, Steady development, Progress step by step, Faithfulness, Persistence
The judgement: Gradual Advance, the maiden is given in marriage, good fortune, it is beneficial to persevere
The judgement description: There is the promise of future success, but you must allow the situation to develop gradually in order to realize it. The Book of Changes compares the situation to a long period of courtship, bethothal, and engagement. The parties must get to know each other and develop bonds of shared commitment and trust to accompany bonds of initial attraction. The couple's families must be brought together. Plans must be established. Ritual formalities must be observed. All of these things take time. What is true of marriage is true of all other forms of courtship and persuation. If you are trying to get other people to make a major commitment, or to do something important, don't expect them to be convinced overnight. You must be considerate and allow them to move toward a decision gradually after they have obtained the requisite level of trust and confidence. If you allow things to develop at their own pace, you will lay a firm foundation for your future success. Don't be anxious for quick results or greedy to get everything at once. You may well get some short-term benefits, but in the long term nothing good will come of it and what you have won in this fashion is unlikely to endure. Rash or reckless action will undermine the very features of the situation that are likely to produce the most good for the longest period of time. You must be patient and have faith that things will work out as they must, exactly in the right way. Similarily, do not think you can get immediate results through clever manipulation. This will also backfire. Rather, tried and true methods are the best way to obtain a positive outcome. Although you must be patient, that does not mean that you should do nothing. To the contrary, you should continually focus on your long-term goal. Progress will often be slow. Hence you must persevere in order that things do not bog down. Be gentle. Do not try to force matters. As new problems arise - and they will invetiably will, remain adaptable and flexible. Externally, maintain poise and calm. Internally, maintain your determination to succeed. Similar concerns apply to the cultivation of your character. Perhaps you want to reform your life or make a change to a more rewarding lifestyle. It is entirely appropriate that you make some changes at once. But you cannot become a completely better, happier person overnight. You will need time to adjust to the new conditions.

Gui Mei - The Marrying Maiden
------------
Above: IChingClasses.Zhen - Thunder, Below: IChingClasses.Dui, Lake
Number: 54
Keywords: The Maiden given in marriage, Playing a subordinate role, subordonation, keeping in the background
The judgement: The Marrying Maiden. To set forth brings misfortune. There is nothing for which this is beneficial.
The judgement description: Under the current circumstances you must play a subordinate role. Your contributions are not being fully recognized and your worth is not fully appreciated. However, for the moment there is nothing you can do about this. If you try to assert yoursel, people will regard it as inappropriate. You will be either rebuffed or ignored. The text compares your situation to that of a secondary wife in a family in ancient China. The secondary wife had to behave with caution and circumspection. She could not shine too much lest she uncur the wrath of the first wife. She has to be demure and self-sacrificing in order to preserve order and harmony in the family. Her position was very difficult and required the utomst tact and reserve, but if she behaved with suitable discretion, she could find a place of peace and dignity within the household. The best strategy right now is to be flexible and adaptable. You are not going to receive very much recognition for your efforts, so you should be sensible. If your expectations are too unrealistic, then you will only make yourself unhappy. Don't be angry and resentful. Life is not always fair. Accept the situation for the time being. Stay out of the limelight and don't try to draw attention to yourself. Perform your assigned role without show or ceremony. Instead of bemoaning your fate, consider instead how you can be of service and make a contribution. Relationships with others may be particulary difficult now. You cannot control the current situation. In particular, you cannot force other people to love you, you can only behave with love toward them. That means acting out of mercy and acceptance rather than out of anger and bitterness. Do not try to manipulate others and do not allow others to manipulate you. In the long run, what holds human relationships together are charity, tact, and discretion, not demanding everything that is yours but overlooking the inevitable slights and upsets of daily life. Despite your subordinate position, it is still possible to act with honor and dignity. Hold yourself to the highest standards. Take pride in your work and in your good qualities. Belive in yourself even if others do not currently recognize you. By staying true to your own ideals and not allowing your self-worth to be determined by the oppinion of others, you will gain inner strength and obtain inner freedom.
The image: Above the lake there is thunder, this is the image of the maiden given in marriage. Thus the superior person understands the imperfect and the transitory in the light of what endures in the end.

Number: 55
Keywords: Zenith, Fullness, Splendor, Plenty, Being generous, Acting decisively, living in the present, Making the most of the good times
The judgement: Abundance. Success. The king approaches. Do not be sad. Be like the sun at midday.
The judgement description: The sun at noon will surely descend just as it has ascended. But in the meantime it shines brightly, bestowing warmth and radience on everything beneath it. In the same way, you now face a moment of rare brilliance and abundance. Everything is now possible. Relationships will flourish. Your ambitions can be achieved. Make the most of this time. Do not worry that things will not always be this perfect. That will only cause you to freeze up. If you mourn what has not yet happned, you will waste your opportunity to do good in the present. Therefore , the text advices you to be like the sun at middday - joyous, powerful, energetic, and happy. Size up the problems before you. Wigh the circumstances objectively. Then go out and take care of business. Success is assured. It is your time to shine. How can you make the good times last as long as possible? The answer, once again, is to take your cue from the sun. The sun is the very symbol of optimism and generosity: it does not try to keep its warmth and energy for itself. It spreads its light throughout the heavens, bringing clarity to everything beneath it. It does not worry that it will burn out someday. Rather, it gives freely, and then it gives some more, and in the way all life on earth is preserved and perpetuated. Like the sun, do what you can to illuminate the world and make your fellow creatures warm and happy. If you want to perpetuate t he good times, share your bounty with others. Do not worry about gain or loss, or about wether you will have enough in the future. If you try and hog the benefits to yoursel, you will cut yourself off from others. People will envy you and refuse to cooperate with you. If you become fearful and obsessed that people are trying to take things from you, you will drain your energies and squander your opportunities. As a result, the good times will pass all the more quickly, and no one will be there to help you on your downward slide. On the other hand, if you share your good fortune with others, they will rejoice in your success and work with you to keep things moving forward. And you in turn will be renewed and stimulated by their goodwill and cooperation. Be optimistic and you will feel better about yourself and your life. Be magnanimous and you will be enriched in countless ways through the gratitude, affection, and support of others. As paradoxical as it seems, the more you give to others, the more will be given to you in return. The less you worry about the transitories of the time of abundance, the longer it will remain with you and those you care for.

Number: 56
Keywords: Traveling, Unsettled, Tentative, uncertain, in transition, exploring, trying new experiences
The judgement: The Wanderer, In small matters, success. Perserverance brings good fortune to the wanderer.
The judgement description: You are in a period of transition. Things are not yet certain, and it is not yet clear how you fit into them or what your identity is supposed to be. The text compares your situation to that of a wanderer who is traveling through a strange land. The wanderer is a sojourner - he does not expect to stay long, but he is not quite sure where he is going next. He knows very few people. He is not exactly sure what the local customs are or whom he can trust. He does not completely understand what is expected of him. Because his sittuation is uncertain, he is circumspect and cautious. He does not call attention to himself nor does he get involved in matters that do not concern him. He associates only with reliable and trustworthy people and does not get involved in anything underhanded or unscrupulous, much less anything that would get him in trouble with the local authorities. Instead, he tries to learn as much as he can from his new souroundings, and in this way he learns something about himself. Apply these principles to your own life. You are on a journey whose destination is not yet determined. This is not a time to make definite commitments. Instead it is a time to explore. You need to gather new information , gain new perspectives, experiment with new ways of living, and meet new people. Don't be afraid to try something different. You won't know what the right path is until you try a number of different possibilities. Be flexible and adaptable and willing to learn. However, precicely because you don't know yet where you are going, you must also be politic and discret. When you find yourself in new situations with new people. be respectful but also reserved. It will take time to know whom you can really trust. Try to associate with good people and make friends with those you respect. This will help keep you out of harm's way and ensure that you get the most out of your new experiences. Relish the uncertainty of this time. You have a wonderful opportunity now to expand your horizons and make important connections. You may well encounter new people and new experiences that will change your life. But don't do anything that is beneath you and don't compromise your integrity just to fit in or to get others to like you. Instead, just be yourself. If you behave with courtesy and discretion, you will attract the right sort of people. A sincere and friendly approach will meet with a natural and positive response, no matter where you are. When people go out of their way to help you, make usre that you let them know that you appreciate their generosity, and then do your best to help them in return. In this way you will begin to form bonds of reciprocity that will help you through this period of transition.

Number: 59
Keywords: Disperion, Dissolution, Getting rid of egotism, bringing people together, finding a common purpose, clearing up blockages, melting the ice, eliminating obstacles within yourself
The judgement: Dispersion. Success. The king approaches his temple. It is beneficial to cross the great river. It is beneficial to persevere
The judgement description: You can now make progress by bringing people together. To do this, you must dissolve the things that keep them apart. Egotism, selfishness, and insecurity have pitted people against each other. They are unable or afraid to communicate with each other openly and sincerely. Hence they pursue their narrow self-interest in a short-sighted way. You have the power to change all that. Strive to clear up misunderstandings and doubts. Work to reconcile people and break up factions and cliques. Progress will come only when you eliminate mutual suspicion and antagosnism and restore harmony and cooperation. The same principles apply with special force to yourself. It is time to break through the barriers that separate you from others. You must dissolve the selfishness and egotism within you. This is the path to happiness and success. To eliminate egotism and dispel misunderstanding, you must excecise gentleness, flexibility, and tact. If you try to force people to come together, they will resist. If you try to domniate people, you will simply drive them further apart. The text compares the best strategy to wind blowing gently over floes of ice that separate people. Over time, the ice melts and the barriers that once divided people are gradually removed. In the same way, you need to open channels of communication slowly and give people a sense of comfort with each other. Gradually , they will begin to come together. The melting of ice starts slowly at first and then proceeds more quickly, the same is true of trust. Trust begins in little things and then , once it is established, the forces of solidarity and reconciliation build on each other more rapidly. What is the best way to dissolve faction and bring people together? The text offers two solutions - the first is a great symbol or idea, the second is a great project.
The text says the king approaches his temple. In ancient China, religious ceremonies brought people together both physically and spiritually and called on their common commitments and belifs. Rituals and sacred music inspired them and bound them together emotionally. Invoking tradition through symbols and religious ceremony gave people a sense that they were one people with a long history and a common destiny. If you want to dissolve the barriers that separate people, you should appeal to their shared beliefs and practices. Remind people of the many things they have in common. It may be a common history, a common set of values, a common tradition, or an everyday activity common to all. Invoke a great idea or cause that everyone can believe in and rally around. Draw on symbols of shared history and community. When people feel that they are keeping faith with something noble and valuable that is greater than themselves, their estrangement and selfishness will dissolve and they will rally together. Similarily, the text says that it is beneficial to cross the great river. If you want to remedy alienation, you must give people a shared sense of purpose. Call them together to a great understaking. Set a high and noble goal. When people work together on a single task, the barriers between them begin to dissolve. If you cannot get people to work on something big, start with something small. Laboring together, even on something minor, has an important symbolic effect. Cooperating on joint projects allows people to find what they have in common. It humanizes others and lets the participants see each other as allies rather than adversaries. Instead of worrying about whether others will grab something that is theirs, people instead focus on whether they will be able to reach a common goal. And when they achieve that goal together, they will celebrate as one.

IChingClasses.Jie - Limitation
-------------------
Above: IChingClasses.Kan, water Below: IChingClasses.Dui, lake
Number 60
Keywords: Control, restriction, limitation, articulation, separate and distinguish, setting boundaries, constraint, self-control
The judgement: Limitation. Success. One should not engage in bitter limitation
The judgement description: Limitation is a necessary element of a happy life. Limiting expenditures is necessary to remain solvent, limiting passions is necessary for maturity and sound judgement. The best limitations are those we choose for ourselves. They strenghten our character and make life easier to bear. You are facing a situation in which limitation is necessary. Perhaps you have taken on to much, or perhaps you have become self-indulgent or carried things to extremes. Whatever the problem, it is up to you to rectify matters by enforcing boundaries and reining things in a bit. Moderation is the key here. You have to strike a new balance in your life. To do that you will need to exercise some self-restraint. If you work at self discipline, it will eventually come naturally to you. Adopt good habits and doing the right thing will become easy rather than a burden. The same principles apply to your finances. Keep an eye on your expenditures, and void anything that is too extravagant. Be prudent without being stingy. Limitation means setting priorities. Decide what your responsabilities are and be prepared to live up to them. You may have to make some tradeoffs. Short0term sacrifices may be necessary. But in the long run, it will be worth it. You cannot have everything in life. You need to decide what is most important to you. That is how to achieve peace of mind. You may be facing limitation in your everyday environment. If so, be realistic. Don't bite more than you can chew. Accomodate yourself to present conditions with optimism and good humor. Accept the restrictions with grace and without rancor. You can do more now if you remain adaptable and flexible. Don't give up hope, instead, make the most out of what you have. Be content to make progress in smaller steps, taking one thing at a time. Don't try to do more than present circumstances allow. Limitation is good when it strenghtens people, increases their self-control, and makes them more self-reliant. It is bad when it is punitive and counter-productive. You will gain nothing by being to hard on yourself. Your goal should be balance and moderation, not asceticism or self-abuse. Similarily, if you are too hard on others , your attempts at discipline will do you and them no good. People will either lose confidence in you or they will rebel at your attempts to control them. Thus the text says that you should avoid bitter limitation, because that is going too far. You need to excercise restraint in all things, including the exercise of restraint itself.
The image: Above the lake is water. This is the image of Limitation. Thus the superior person establishes measures and limits, and deliberates about the nature of virtuous conduct.

-------------------------
Above: IChingClasses.Xun, wind Below: IChingClasses.Dui, lake
Number: 61
Keywords: Inner sincerity, inner faithfulness, trustworthiness, conformity between what is outside and what is inside.
The judgement: The Book of Changes regards truth as one of the most powerful forces in the universe. If you want to influence other people, there is no better way than through the truth that lies within you. Possesing inner truth means that you are sincere. You are on the inside what you appear to be on the outside. You are honest and genuine both in your words and your deeds. You say what you mean and you mean what you say. Such a person naturally inspires trust and confidence in others. Even the most difficult and contentious people will respond to someone whom they recognize is sincere and aboveboard. The most powerful advocates are those who genuinely believe in the rightness of their cause. Many speaks try to win influence by manipulating or flattering others. They may confuse and even impress momentarily, but their audiences do not really trust them. On the other hand, when people are completly sincere, their character shines through to others with the most powerful effect. Indeed, the text says that even pigs and fishes respond to the power of inner truth. To influence others, you must approach them in the proper manner. If you want them to be receptive to you, then you must also be receptive to them. Listen to what other people have to say. Try to see things from their point of view. Open your heart and your mind and assume that you have as much to learn from them as they have to learn from you. When you do this, you will be able to see the truth in their way of thinking, and they, in turn, will be able to see truth in yours. Once you understand what is important to them, you will be able to express yourself in the right way. Nevertheless, inner truth is not simply a device for persuading others. It is a way of living your life. The word truth, is also the word for confidence, trust, and reliability. If you want to have these things in your dealing with the outside world, you must possess each of them within. First, to possess inner truth you must know yourself. Then you can trust your instincts in any situation. Second, to possess inner truth means that ou have personal integrity, a stable center, and a core of beliefs and principles to which you remain true. If you lack these things, your life will be shallow and unfulfilling. You cannot compensate for them by relying on other people and things to give yourself stability or fill and inner emptiness. Third, inner truth means inner confidence. To possess inner truth means that you are self-reliant and have faith in yourself. If you are conflicted and uncertain, this will be reflected in your behavior and in dealings with others. As a result, people will lose confidence in you. You must belive in yourself if you want others to belive in you. Indeed, you will find that the power of inner truth is contagious. A person with supreme confidence inspires others and gives them confidence as well. Fourth, to possess inner truth means that you must be honest with yourself. Self-deception will inevitably affect your choices and your relationships. People who hide things from themselves cannot help hiding things from others. That is why inner truth is crucial to behaving with rectitude toward the outside world. You cannot be true to others if you are not true to yourself.
The image: Wind over lake, this is the image of Inner Truth. Thus the superior person discusses criminal cases carefully and postpones executions

The judgement description: This is not the time to undertake something big or difficult. Conditions are not in your favor for significant accomplishment. You lack the strength and resources to achive what you would like. Therefore, you need to understand the demands of the time and scale back your expectations.

If the little bird attempts to fly to high, it will get into trouble. But if it stays low, it will be safe and find its nest.

If you resolve to undertake only small things but do them well, you will get through this difficult period in good shape.

The judgement: After Completion. Success in small matters. It is beneficial to persevere, In the begining, good fortune. In the end, disorder.
The judgement description: The situation has reached completion. You have achieved what you wanted. Details remain to be worked out, but the essentioal features have been achieved. It is perfectly all right to celebrate your acomplishments. But now the next phase of your efforts must begin. The final elements must be hammered into place. Promisses and commitments must be fulfilled. And after all of this is done, you must maintain your new position and consolidate your good fortune. The key is not to let success go to your head. You may be tempted to relax and let things move along on their own momentum. But that would be a mistake. Keeping things running smoothly will take effort. The law of change holds that as soon as things have reached perfection, they will begin to disintegrate. As soon as a person achieves success, problems begin to emerge. Those problems become more serious unless you deal with them at the outset. Therefore, your task is to maintain the fruits of your victory and to eliminate difficulties and obstacles before they have a chance to grow large. Don't regard any part of the task as beneath you. Pay careful attention to detail. Keep alert to any signs of possible decay in the situation. Do not take your previous successes for granted. Instead, continue to nurture the situation and strive to keep things healthy and vital. Now is definitely not the time to slack off. If you don't make the effort to consolidate your gains, you will lose them. But if you pay attention to the little things, you can keep the situation in good order and enjoy the benefits of your hard-won success. The key is devotion and perserverence. The lesson of this hexagram is that when things have reached completion, your work has only begun.

It is a great responsibility. The problem is, you don't yet know what to do. There are contradictory indication and contradictory forces at work in the situation. You feel tugged at from all sides. You you must make a decision. The text compares your situation to that of an old fox that is trying to cross a frozen river. It does not know there the ice is to thin. Therefore, it proceeds slowly and cautiously, listening carefully for the first sounds of a crack in the surface. No matter how dar across it is, it does not lose its balancec or caution. By contrast, a young fox lacks this prudence and circumspection, if it rushes ahead boldly when it is nearly across the river, it may fall into the icy waters. In the same way, when you are trying to bring order to a confusing situation, you must begin slowly and methodically, First of all, decide what your goals truly are. There is no sense of starting out if you don't know there you want to go. Clarifying what you want the outcome to be will go a long way toward forumlating the right strategy. Second, don't rush matters. Rome wasn't built in a day. Take things one step at a time. Don't try to resolve everythinig at once. Third, be wary. Take the time to gather information and intelligence. Deliberate thorhoughly about the best way to proceed. In sum, be like an old fox navigating the ice, cautios, alert, flexible, surefooted, and willing to change direction at a moment's notice.
