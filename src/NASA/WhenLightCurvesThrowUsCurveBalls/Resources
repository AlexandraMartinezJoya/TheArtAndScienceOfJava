PAPERS ON LIGHT CURVES

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abb9

Note this paper uses the technique of inverse modeling (with certain assumptions about the shape of the asteroid).
In this challenge, however, we suggest you use forward modeling, starting with the asteroid shape and calculating the light curve

Caption: Light curve for Leucus from 2018 data from Mottola et al., 2020).
T0 is the observation starting point using one-way, light-travel time corrected, Modified Julian Dates (MJD).
The listed rotation periods are the exact numbers used for computing the rotational phase, and are reported without uncertainty.
 Data points beyond rotation phase 1.0 are repeated for clarity.
